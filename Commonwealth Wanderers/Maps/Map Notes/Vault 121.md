### **Vault 121 – The Vault of Mildly Inconvenient Technology**

**Location:** Somewhere in the South of Boston.

#### **Vault-Tec's Mission Statement:**

_"Perfection is a lie. The human mind is most adaptable when faced with minor adversity. Vault 121 is designed to test the effects of persistent but minor inefficiencies on long-term psychological and societal stability."_

#### **The Experiment:**

Unlike other Vaults designed for extreme psychological stress or catastrophic failure, **Vault 121 was built to be a nearly perfect, functional Vault—but with one key flaw: Everything was just a little bit wrong.**

- **Doors open half a second too late** – not enough to cause real frustration, but noticeable.
- **Lighting flickers briefly once every few hours**, just enough to make you think you're imagining it.
- **Water temperature fluctuates by a couple of degrees** unexpectedly while showering.
- **Pip-Boys are perfectly functional, but scrolling through menus skips past the option you wanted once in a while.**
- **Elevators take just slightly too long to arrive**—not dramatically, but enough to make you consider taking the stairs.
- **Alarm clocks go off a minute before or after they’re set**—never precisely when intended.
- **Cafeteria trays are slightly too small to fit a full meal comfortably.**
- **The Overseer’s PA announcements always have a brief, awkward pause before starting.**
- **Every year, the Vault’s calendar is off by one day**, leading to minor scheduling confusions.
- **Books, terminals, and posters have just one or two typos**, but not enough to make them unreadable.

Everything **functions**—there are no life-threatening issues—but nothing is ever truly _satisfying_.

#### **Outcome and Fallout:**

- **Early Years:** The first generation of Vault 121 residents mostly shrugged off the issues, chalking them up to maintenance quirks. However, over time, mild frustrations built up.
- **Mid-Term Generations:** A culture of **hyper-patient, overly detail-oriented people** emerged. Residents began developing coping mechanisms such as over-explaining things, rechecking every detail multiple times, and inventing small personal rituals to avoid inconveniences.
- **Long-Term Effect:** By the time the Vault eventually opened, **Vault 121 dwellers were some of the most prepared, adaptable, and persistent people in the Wasteland.** While other Vaults produced lunatics, raiders, or hyper-isolated societies, Vault 121’s survivors were **mostly normal**—but **incredibly good at tolerating minor setbacks**.

#### **Vault 121 in the Wasteland:**

- Vault 121 dwellers are known for **being eerily patient and calm in stressful situations**—they've spent generations enduring small annoyances, so nothing really fazes them.
- Their descendants have a **strange obsession with precision and efficiency**, often going out of their way to _fix_ minor inconveniences others wouldn't even notice.
- If something _actually_ goes wrong in the Wasteland, they react **way too rationally**, causing outsiders to think they lack emotion.
- They have an informal saying: _“It could be worse, but it could also be better.”_
