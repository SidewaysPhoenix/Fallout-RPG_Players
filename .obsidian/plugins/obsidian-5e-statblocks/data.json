These creatures are incredibly fast and agile, making them a difficult opponent to face in a swarm, and rush at their prey to bring it down as quickly as possible. They create nests both on the ground and at heights, which can be spotted by the bright yellow honey-like ooze they secrete. If nests are disturbed or threatened, a swarm of stingwings often emerge to defend it.",

Despite their compact size, they areoutfitted with a number of useful technologies; long range antennas that allow them to receive radio broadcasts even in subway stations or other underground sites, facial and voice recognition for use insecurity applications and even a laser weapon. In pre-War America they were used to broadcast radio transmissions,announcements, and news bulletins. Now these eyebots are in use by the likes of the Brotherhood of Steel to promote propaganda and by the Minutemen for surveillance. Others can are roaming the wastes still following their original programming and broadcasting the local radio station, military chatter on repeat or mysterious messages and frequencies from unknown sources. While often friendly when encountered, they will defend themselves if attacked and thedegradation to their systems leads some units to be hostile on site.",

All models of Mister Handy feature a nuclear power unit and a jet thruster which allows them to hover. They also all feature sophisticated programming, which allows them to mimic, understand, and learn human behavior. Several limiters within its system prevent them fromdeviating from their programming, but in units where these limiters are removed or damaged, it is not unusual to see Mister Handys developing their own independent personalities and a level of intelligence above their original design.",

Their specialist military programming allows them to receive and understand orders in real time, increased aggression in combat and even the ability to give them ranks alongside human soldiers. It is this programming which also gives them their unique Marine drill sergeant personality. With many Mister Gutsys now lacking orders, incapable of understanding the war is over, with their commanders long dead, they can often be found still protecting the military bases on which they serve or wandering nearby.

Moving on wheels rather than legs or jet thrusters, Sentry bots are formidable, possessing heavy armor that can easily withstand direct hits from missiles and mini nukes. Their inbuilt weaponry also includes an automatic chain gun and in some cases missiles. While their design is to take out their enemies from a distance, they are also capable of melee attacks with devastating results. Some models were even equipped with self-destruct programming, both for a last-ditch attempt to take out the enemy but also to prevent the unit falling into enemy hands. Sentry bots are often found in military or scientific installations, though some models appear to have been used for non-military means, such as general security. In rare cases it is possible to find that some sentry bots, like a select few of their Mister Handy cousins, seem to have grown past their original programming (such as Ironsides whocaptains the USS Constitution and its robotic crew), or those which have been reprogrammed and are kept as domestic guard bots. In most cases however, few who come across them in the wasteland survive the encounter. ",

Telling a raider psycho apart from others is not always easy, but they tend to lack firearms and have tougher armor that covers more of the head, arms and torso to protect them in melee combat.",

Despite their initial premise, these robots became a joke amongst American soldiers due to their poor design and sloppy execution. That was until the Fujiniya Intelligence Base became involved and improved the design from within the U.S. itself. These new bots (designated Mark 0–V) sported a variety of improvements, from propaganda-disseminating speakers to upgraded weapons systems. These bots were now a force to be reckoned with and no longer accidentally self-destructed due to incorrectly determining its capture. The PLA quickly accepted this new design, but before the units could be rolled out, the Great War broke out, stifling any plans for deployment. If it weren’t for the Enclave seizing the covert Fujiniya Intelligence Base, it is likely wastelanders would never have seen these bots.",

As a resident scientist and doctor at the Hub, Grey was drawn into an ill-fated expedition to Mariposa Military Base, where he was immersed in a vat of Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). Left for dead and in indescribable agony, Grey slowly mutated beyond all recognition. His new shambling form absorbed the forms and intellects of any creature, or computer, that got too close. Through trial and experimentation, he found that creatures exposed to the FEV exhibited increased, and delectable, intelligence. Thus began his experiments. First came the centaurs: created from dogs and rats; later came the super mutants: created from humans. Realizing he needed specimens untainted by the background FEV and radiation of the wasteland to create a new race perfectly adapted to the new world, he sent his ever-growing army of super mutants to hunt for “prime normals.” After exposing an untainted human to the FEV, he created another super-intellect which he subsequently assimilated. It was these debaucherous acts that truly created the Master hive mind.",

All he had to do to atone for his crime was allow himself to be isolated for a month while recording his observations. But this simple punishment turned into a nightmare as, unbeknownst to Swann; he had been infected with FEV. The first two weeks seemed successful, with Swann experiencing increased intelligence and muscle mass. But by the third week, his body betrayed him, becoming unstable and mutating beyond control. His worst fears were realized as he was exiled from the Institute, as so many failed experiments had been before him. He took refuge at Boston Common before losing his last shred of humanity and becoming one of, if not the first super mutant behemoth in the Commonwealth. He can still be found there today, wearing armor formed from broken swan boats and wielding a giant anchor. His only memory is his name which he roars when disturbed, “SWAAAAANNN!!!”",

Despite this distrust, he still works alongside them, commanding the rank-and-file soldiers of the Enclave, being the sole communication between Eden and the troops and scientists. Under his command, the Enclave restarted secret programs to develop weapons and technology, including the impressive hellfire armor. Despite his station, Augustus is a relatively moderate individual fighting towards his own ideas of freedom and progress for the American people, standing in contrast with the Enclave’s plans to eradicate all mutant life. His organization’s members respect him and follow his orders with trust and conviction, believing themselves to be the last of the Enclave.",

This was not to last forever, as he was eventually demoted to patrol the Wastelands after an episode of psychosis. During a routine patrol, he came into contact with the FEV and the Enclave took notice. Moved to their oil rig headquarters for testing and observation, Frank Horrigan was kept inoculated and unconscious as he transformed. Already a man of impressive physique, stature, and low intellect, the FEV took to him naturally. Mixing this with the genetic tapering and enhancements of the Enclave, what came out of hibernation was more monster than man. Now fused to experimental power armor and having grown to a colossal size, Frank is unlike anything the Wasteland has seen. The Enclave preying on his low intelligence and prior allegiance to the president conditioned him to become their lap dog. An unforeseen result of his transformation was the genetic instability it has caused, and now, without the constant feed of stabilizers and drugs his armor provides, he would die. \n\n Strangely, Franky does not consider himself a mutant, often referring to others as *muties*. This is not a mindset shared by his allies, who are so scared of this freak that they often blankly refuse to take part in any mission to which he is assigned. \n\n Frank is a violent man choosing guns and steel to resolve his problems over words, a decision he often comes to with alarming speed.",

Edward learned much about the pre-War world from his time in the libraries of the Followers. It wasn’t until after being captured by the Blackfoot tribe and seeing their primitive ways of making war that Edward realized the use of his knowledge. Unwilling to leave his companion, Joshua Graham, in the hands of these soon-to-be conquered savages, Edward taught them the ways of total war. Gaining victory with his tactics, the Blackfoots soon regarded him as their leader. Taking the name of 'Caesar' for himself, he reshaped the tribes under his command into his new Legion, modeled on the ancient Roman army. Following his namesake’s conquest of Gaul, he began his campaign to bring Pax Romana to the post-apocalyptic world. \n\n Absorbing any defeated tribe he deemed of worth, Caesar soon stood at the head of a vast nomadic army until he reached his Rubicon—the Colorado River. \n\n The Legion’s first foray across the Hoover Dam ended in defeat and retreat. Caesar’s second, Graham, now Malpais Legate, was set aflame and cast himself into the Grand Canyon for his failure. Caesar amassed his forces on the eastern side of Hoover Dam, planned to defeat the NCR, and hoped to establish his new empire with New Vegas as his New Rome.",
