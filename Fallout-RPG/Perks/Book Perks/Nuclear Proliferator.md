Ranks: 3 
Requirements: Rare perk, Level 11+ 

You’ve discovered the plans for a type of lightweight nuclear warhead (see sidebar). However, the radioactive material decays very quickly, and the device becomes useless after a matter of hours. 
* At rank 1, each device created becomes useless 6 hours after being created. 
* At rank 2, this increases to 12 hours. 
* At rank 3, this increases to 24 hours. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 6.**
