When you kill an enemy with a melee weapon, you may spend a Luck point to make them explode. 
* If they explode, roll a number of D6 equal to half your melee weapon’s damage rating (round down). 
* For each Effect rolled, one creature within Close range of the exploding enemy (starting with the closest, GM’s discretion) suffers physical damage equal to the total rolled on the D6.
