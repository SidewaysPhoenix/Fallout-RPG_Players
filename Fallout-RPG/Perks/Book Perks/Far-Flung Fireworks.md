When you kill an enemy with a ranged weapon, you may spend 1 Luck point to make them explode. 
* If they explode, roll a number of D6 equal to half your melee weapon’s damage rating (round down). 
* For each Effect rolled, one creature within Close range of the exploding enemy (starting with the closest, GM’s discretion) suffers Physical damage equal to the total rolled on the D6.
