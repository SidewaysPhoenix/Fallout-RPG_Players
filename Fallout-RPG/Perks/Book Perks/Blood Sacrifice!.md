**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare book, Level 6+ 

When you are reduced to 0 HP, all other party members and companions gain +2 to Physical and Energy damage resistance, and immediately regain 4 HP. 

* At rank 2, increase the amount of HP regained by 2. 
* At rank 3, increase the amount of Physical and Energy damage resistance +3 each, and increase the amount of HP regained by a further +2. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 6.**
