**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare perk, Level 11+ 

You’ve discovered the recipe to a potent combat stimulant, [[Super Chem MK I]] (see sidebar) which makes you far tougher and deadlier in a fight with few drawbacks. However, the drug has a very short lifespan, and the mixture becomes useless after a matter of hours. 

* At rank 1, each dose created becomes useless 6 hours after being created. 
* At rank 2, this increases to 12 hours. 
* At rank 3, this increases to 24 hours. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
