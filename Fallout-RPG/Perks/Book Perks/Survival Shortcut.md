**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare perk, Level 11+ 

You’ve discovered the recipe to a potent medicine, the Survival Syringe (see sidebar) which seems like a miracle cure-all. However, the dug has a very short lifespan, and the mixture becomes useless after a matter of hours. 

* At rank 1, each dose created becomes useless 6 hours after being created. 
* At rank 2, this increases to 12 hours. 
* At rank 3, this increases to 24 hours. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
