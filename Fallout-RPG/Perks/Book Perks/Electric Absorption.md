**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare perk, Level 9+ 

Once per scene, if you are a robot or wearing power armor, when you are hit by an attack dealing Energy damage, you may spend a Luck point to absorb that attack. 
* An absorbed attack deals no damage. Instead, you regain HP (if in power armor, these will be Armor HP on the location hit) equal to the number of Effects rolled on the attack’s damage roll. 
	* In addition, power armor regains one charge to its fusion core. At higher ranks, this perk may be used a number of times per scene equal to its rank. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 9.**
