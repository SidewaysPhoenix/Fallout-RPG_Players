**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare perk, Level 7+ 

When you are wearing a full set of a single type of armor—i.e., all Sturdy Leather Armor, or all Heavy Combat Armor, or all T-51 Power Armor, on all the locations which can have a piece of that type of armor—you gain an additional +5 Poison damage resistance. 

* At rank 2, this increases to +8. 
* At rank 3, this increases to +10. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 7.**
