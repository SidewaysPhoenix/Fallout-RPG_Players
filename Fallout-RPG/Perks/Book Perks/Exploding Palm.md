**Ranks:** 3 
**Requirements:** Rare perk, Level 9+ 

When you succeed at a melee attack with an Unarmed weapon, you may spend 1 AP for the attack to be an Exploding Palm strike: 
* When making an Exploding Palm strike, each Effect rolled causes one enemy within Close range of the target (starting with those within Reach of the initial target, excluding yourself) to suffer 3 D6 physical damage. 
* At rank 2, the explosion damage increases to 4 D6. At rank 3, this increases to 5 D6. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 9.**
