When you kill an enemy with a thrown explosive weapon, you may spend a Luck point to make them explode. 
* If they explode, roll a number of D6 equal to half your explosive weapon’s damage rating (round down). 
* For each Effect rolled, one creature within Close range of the exploding enemy (starting with the closest, GM’s discretion) suffers Physical damage equal to the total rolled on the D6. 

Resolve exploding enemies after you finish resolving the attack with the explosive weapon.
