**Ranks:** 2  

You may Charge as a major action if you are wearing Power Armor or are a super mutant. This is a movement action, and you may not [[Move]] or [[Sprint]] in the same turn.  

* At rank 1, when you take this action, you move into reach of an enemy within Medium range (1 zone) and make a **STR + Athletics** test with a difficulty of 2. 
	* If you succeed, the enemy suffers damage equal to your normal unarmed damage, and is **knocked prone**.  

* At rank 2, you add +1D6 damage and the [[Stun]] damage effect to the damage inflicted. 

At the GM’s discretion, especially large or sturdy creatures cannot be knocked prone by this action.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
