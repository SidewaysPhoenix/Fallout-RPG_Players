**Ranks:** 2

* At rank 1, whenever a creature NPC with the **Mammal**, **Lizard**, or **Insect** keyword would attack you, roll 1D6 : 
	* On any result other than an Effect, the creature chooses not to attack you, although it may still attack another character it can target. 

* At rank 2, you can attempt a **CHA + Survival** test with a difficulty of 2 as a major action. If you succeed, the animal treats you as friendly and will attack anyone who attacks you. **Mighty** and **Legendary** animals are unaffected by this perk. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
