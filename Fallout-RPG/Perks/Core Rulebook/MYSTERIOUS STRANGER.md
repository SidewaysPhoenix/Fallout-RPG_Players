From time to time, a Mysterious Stranger comes to your aid, with lethal results.  

At the start of a combat encounter, you may spend 1 Luck point. If you do so, then at any point during the scene, the GM may have the Mysterious Stranger appear, make a single ranged attack against an enemy you attacked, or who just attacked you, and then vanish.  

**If you spend a Luck point and the Mysterious Stranger does not appear, the GM must refund the Luck point you spent.**  

The stranger has:
* AGI of 10
* Small Guns skill of 6
* Small Guns as a Tag skill. 
* They always roll **3d20** for attacks, rather than 2d20
	* Using a custom .44 Magnum revolver—inflicts 8D6 damage, [[Piercing]] 1, and [[Vicious]] physical damage.  

**They always appear within their weapon’s ideal range.** 

Any attempt to find where the Stranger went after their attack fails.
