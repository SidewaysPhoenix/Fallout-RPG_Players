You aren’t alone in the wilderness. You have a pet dog that serves as a friend and ally in dangerous times.  

The dog has the profile shown to the side and is treated as an allied NPC creature under your command (see p.338).  

If you need to forage for food and water, your dog looks after themselves. If your dog is slain, then you either:

* Find a new dog before the next adventure 
* Trade this perk for a different one after this adventure.
