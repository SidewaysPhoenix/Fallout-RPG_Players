**Ranks:** 3

When you suffer damage, the amount of damage needed to inflict a critical hit on you increases by your rank in this perk. 

*For example, if you have one rank in this perk, you suffer a critical hit from 6 or more damage, rather than 5 or more.* 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 3.**
