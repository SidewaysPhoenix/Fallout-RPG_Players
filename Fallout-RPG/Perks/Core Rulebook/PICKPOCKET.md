##### Pickin’ Pockets 
Stealing an item carried by someone else, or secreting an item upon their person, is a surprisingly valuable survival trick in the wasteland, and it’s useful to have some sense of how easy or difficult a given theft is likely to be. 

Picking pockets is an AGI + Sneak test, with a base difficulty of 1. Success allows you to take an item weighing 1lb or less from another character’s pockets, belt pouches, etc., or to place an item of that size into a pocket, etc., without being detected. Failure means your attempt was noticed. 

If the item you’re stealing/planting weighs more than 1 lb., then the difficulty increases by 1. If it weighs more than 10 lbs., then the difficulty increases by 2 instead. Similarly, especially talented pickpockets can remove small items a person is wearing—such as stealing a wristwatch during a handshake—this test is also at +1 difficulty. 

Picking pockets can become an opposed test if the target is wary or suspicious.
