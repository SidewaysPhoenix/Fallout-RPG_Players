Water is your ally. 

* At rank 1, you no longer take radiation damage from swimming in irradiated water, and you can hold your breath for twice as long as normal. 

* At rank 2, enemies add +2 to the difficulty to tests to detect you while you are submerged underwater. 

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 3.**
