**Ranks:** 3  

Whenever you roll to determine how much ammunition you find, you find more.  

- At rank 1, you find +3D6 additional shots.  
- At rank 2, you find +6D6 additional shots.  
- At rank 3, you find +10D6 additional shots.  

The additional ammo you find is the same as initially found. 

*For example, if you find 10mm ammunition, this perk increases how much 10mm ammo you find. If you find multiple types of ammunition, Scrounger applies to the ammunition with the lowest rarity (GM’s choice if there is a tie).*  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
