**Ranks:** 3  

You may attempt to butcher a dead human, requiring an **END + Survival** test with a difficulty of 0.  
- Success yields one portion of human flesh, which you may immediately consume.  
- To you, human flesh counts as a food item which restores 4 HP and is Irradiated (*roll 1 d6 and suffer 1 Radiation damage if an Effect is rolled*).  
- Consuming human flesh is regarded as abhorrent by most people and is a crime in most settlements.  

At rank 2, you may also butcher ghouls in this way.  
At rank 3, you may also butcher super mutants in this way.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 9.**  

**Super mutants may ignore the level requirement for the first rank only.**

### *Dark Cravings*  

**Cannibalism can be addictive**: after consuming **human flesh**, roll **1d6 equal to the number of times you’ve eaten human flesh this session**.  

- If **two or more Effects are rolled**, you are **addicted**.  
- While **addicted**, **no food** will satisfy your hunger **other than human flesh** (*which moves you immediately to the sated state*).  
- After **four hours of being sated**, you **immediately gain 1 Fatigue and become starving, skipping the intervening states**.  

This can be **cured in the same way** as **other addictions**.
