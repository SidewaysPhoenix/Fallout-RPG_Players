* From time to time, a Mysterious Savior comes to your aid, with lethal results.  

	* At the start of a combat encounter, you may spend 1 Luck point.  
	* If you do so, then the first time during the scene you start dying, the GM may have the Mysterious Savior appear, revive you, and then vanish.  
	* If you spend a Luck point and the Mysterious Savior does not appear, the GM must refund the Luck point you spent.  

* When the stranger revives you, 
	* They immediately stabilize you as if they had succeeded at a [[First Aid]] action.  
	* You are restored to consciousness, regain 4 HP, as if a [[Stimpak]] had been used on you, and are able to act again during the scene.
