During combat, if no enemy can see you when you start your turn, you may attempt an **AGI + Sneak** test to hide:  

- The difficulty is the number of enemies within Medium range of you.  
- Once hidden, the enemy no longer knows where you are; they may continue to search for you.  
- Enemies do not receive any bonuses to detect you if you take the [[Sprint]] action.
