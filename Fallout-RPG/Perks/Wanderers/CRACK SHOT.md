When you make a ranged attack with a one-handed ranged weapon, and you aimed before the attack,
* The weapon’s range increases by one step (*i.e., from Close to Medium, or from Medium to Long*).  

At rank 2, the weapon also gains the [[Accurate]] quality if it did not already possess it.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 7.**
