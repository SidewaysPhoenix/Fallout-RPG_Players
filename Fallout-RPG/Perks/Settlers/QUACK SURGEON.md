When you attempt a [[First Aid]] action on an ally, you may use an alcoholic beverage on your patient as part of the action.  

- The patient heals additional HP equal to the amount the beverage normally heals, if any.  
- This allows you to heal 2 HP per AP spent.  
- The ally also receives the benefits (and drawbacks) of consuming the beverage.
