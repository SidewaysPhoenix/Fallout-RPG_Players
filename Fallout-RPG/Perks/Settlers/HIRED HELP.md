Some wastelanders are lone wanderers—but not you!  

You gain the ability to recruit a **humanoid** companion. You gain an allied NPC creature that follows your commands (*Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*, p.338).  

Your companion can:  
- Care for their own food and beverages.  
- Recover from injuries like a player character.  
- Benefit from healing.  

Options for companions can be found later in **Chapter 3: Companions and Automatrons**, p.62.  

If your companion is slain, you may:  
- Recruit a new companion before the next quest.  
- Trade this perk for a different one after this quest.
