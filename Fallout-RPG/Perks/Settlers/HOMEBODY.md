**Ranks:** 2  

You do not need to sleep while in a settlement you belong to in order to recuperate.  

- At rank 1, when you spend an hour in a settlement you belong to or manage, roll a number of d6 equal to your **Endurance** rank, and regain its result in HP.  
- At rank 2, you regain an additional hit point per Effect rolled.  
	- Whenever you make an **END + Survival** test to recover from an injury, the difficulty is reduced to a maximum of 2 (light activity on the Injury Recovery Difficulty table, ***Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook***, p.35).  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
