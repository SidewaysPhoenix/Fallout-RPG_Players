During nighttime hours—after sunset and before sunrise—your hunger and thirst states do not reduce.  

When calculating the hours of time to become more hungry or thirsty, ignore the hours of progress to moving down the Hunger States and Thirst States tables (***Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook***, p.191).  

* Every two days you are starving, you gain 1 Fatigue, instead of every day.
