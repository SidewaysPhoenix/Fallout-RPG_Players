You choose to travel the wastelands with a robot companion.  You have a robot companion that serves as a friend and ally in the hazards of the wasteland. 

- You gain an allied NPC creature that follows your commands (***Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook***, p.338).  
- They cannot recover from injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs (*see **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, Chapter Two: Combat, Healing Robots*, p.34).  
- They do not require food or beverages, nor can they gain benefit from consuming them or using chems.  

Options for robot companions for this perk can be found in **Chapter 3: Companions and Automatrons**, p.62.  

- If your robot is destroyed, you either:  
	- Attempt to repair it.  
	- Find or purchase a new one before the next adventure.  
	- Trade this perk for a different one after this quest.
