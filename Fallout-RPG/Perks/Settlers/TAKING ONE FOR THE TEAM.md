**Ranks:** 3  

- At rank 1, whenever a creature NPC would roll to damage an ally in the same zone as you, roll 1d6.  
	- On any result other than an Effect, you take the damage from the attack instead.  
	 - This effect can only trigger once per round of combat per rank you have in this perk.  
- At rank 2, if you take damage from the attack after calculating damage reduction, add 1 AP to the pool for each rank you have in this perk.  
- At rank 3, after you have taken the damage, you and the ally can re-roll 1d20 on the next attack you make against the target that attacked for each rank you have in this perk.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 4.**
