**Ranks:** 3  

When building structures for your settlement, you know how to make the process faster, cheaper, and more efficient.  

- At rank 1, when you start constructing something, you can reduce the number of materials required to construct it by half (to a minimum of 1 unit of each material type), decreasing the overall Happiness by 2.  
	- You can double the amount of construction time required to ignore the reduction in Happiness.  
- At rank 2, you can have a person take a settlement action to construct an object even if they do not have the required skill.  
	- Doing so reduces the settlement’s overall Happiness by 1.  
	* If you have at least one person working on the construction object that has the skill, then you can ignore the reduction in Happiness.  
- At rank 3, you can have a person take a settlement action to construct an object even if they do not have the required perk, but at least one person working on the object still must have the perk.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 4.**
