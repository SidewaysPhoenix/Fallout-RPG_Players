**Ranks:** 2  

You can set traps to protect your property from intruders!  

- At rank 1, you can craft traps from the Traps section, p.189.  
	- Traps have a complexity of 2 and require the components for a complexity 2 item.  
	- If you fail the **INT + Repair** test, your trap misfires—resolve the trap’s effect against yourself.  
- At rank 2, when you fail the **INT + Repair** test to set the trap, it does not misfire.  
	* Instead, you succeed at cost, and the GM creates a **complication** related to the trap (e.g., it is easier to spot, deals less damage, or does not work as intended).  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 5.**
