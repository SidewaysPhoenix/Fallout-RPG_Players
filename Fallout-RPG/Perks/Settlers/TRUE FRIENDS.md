**Ranks:** 1  

Making friends is second nature for you, and more importantly, the friendships that you form are stronger than most.  

- At rank 1, when a reputation test results in decreasing your reputation with a faction or settlement, you can:  
	 - Roll a number of d6 equal to your current reputation.  
	 - If you roll at least one Effect, your reputation does not change.  
	 - You must increase your reputation by 1 before you can use this perk with the same faction or settlement again.  
- At rank 2, when you perform an action that would increase the affinity with an individual, faction, or settlement, you can roll a **CHA + Speech** test with a difficulty of 3.  
	 - With a success, you can instead increase the affinity by 2.  
	 - With a failure on the test, the affinity does not change.  
	 - You must increase the affinity by 1 before you can use this perk with the same target.
