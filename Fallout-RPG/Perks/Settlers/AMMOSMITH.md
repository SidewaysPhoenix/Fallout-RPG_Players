**Ranks:** 3  

Sometimes you have the wrong bullets for the right gun, and somehow you make it work with the materials that you have.  

You can craft a single piece of ammunition using materials at a weapons workbench, treating its rarity as its [[Crafting Complexity]] (*Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*, p.211).  

- At rank 1, you can craft ammunition up to **rarity 1**.  
- At rank 2, you can craft ammunition up to **rarity 3**.
	- Additionally, you can now **dismantle ammunition**, gaining half of the materials normally required to craft the ammunition (rounded down to a minimum of 1).  
- At rank 3, you can craft ammunition up to **rarity 5**.  

**When crafting ammunition,** 
* You can roll a number of d6 equal to 6 reduced by the rarity of the ammunition being crafted.  
- Every hit rolled increases the amount of ammunition crafted by **+1**.  
- For every effect rolled, **double** the amount of ammunition crafted.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 4.**
