- If you roll any Effects, you regain half the components you spent (rounding down).  
- Check each rarity of the components separately and regain half of each, rounding down.  

At rank 2, you roll 2 d6.  
At rank 3, you roll 3 d6.  

**Each time you take this perk, the level requirement increases by 4.**
