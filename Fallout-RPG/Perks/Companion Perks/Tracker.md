The companion’s keen senses allow them to detect the trails left by prey and threats alike, and they’re trained to guide their owner to follow those trails. Whenever the companion makes a skill test, or assists a skill test, to track another creature, the difficulty of the test is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. In addition, the companion may re-roll its dice when it assists on these skill tests.
