Your companion is known to pick up on subtle, often imperceptible signs of trouble that you might otherwise be unaware of. At the start of combat, if any enemies would act before you (because of surprise, because they have a higher Initiative, or because the GM spent Luck to have them act first), roll a D6 : add AP to the group pool from your companion’s warning equal to the total rolled on the D6 (Effects count as 1).
