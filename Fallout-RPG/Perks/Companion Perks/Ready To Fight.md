This companion has been trained for battle. When you succeed at an attack, your companion attacks as well, choosing to make a ranged attack or a melee attack (it may need to move before making this attack). The companion’s attack hits automatically, but inflicts half the listed damage (round up), to a minimum of 2 D6. If the companion is a Creature with natural melee attacks, at 5th level, and every 5 levels beyond that, add +1 D6 damage to one of the creature’s natural melee attacks.
