The companion is used to hunting as a group, carefully encircling prey to trap them. At the start of a scene, you may spend 1 Luck point to declare the companion to be ‘prowling’ and will not be present: they are somewhere nearby, waiting. At any point during the scene—at the start of any of your turns in combat— the companion may appear, emerging from hiding. They may appear anywhere, so long as there is darkness or some other sort of concealment to emerge from.
