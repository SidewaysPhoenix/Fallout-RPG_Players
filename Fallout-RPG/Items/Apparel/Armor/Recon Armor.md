name: "Recon Armor"
desc: "A lightweight form of armor commonly used by the Brotherhood of Steel, Recon Armor is a padded, flame-retardant jumpsuit and hood designed to be worn underneath a suit of T-45 power armor, protecting the wearer from moving parts within the suit, and the heat the suit’s components give off. The jumpsuit is also designed to provide limited protection from small arms fire, for situations where the wearer needs to leave their armor in the field—for stealth reconnaissance, or performing tasks that require fine manipulation impossible within power armor. \n\n Recon Armor cannot accept mods. It is considered light armor."
