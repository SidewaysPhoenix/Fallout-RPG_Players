desc: "Scout Armor is a refinement of military combat armor, developed by the Enclave following the Great War, and it is used mainly by Enclave covert forces. The armor is typically painted in a variety of camouflage schemes, and is designed to be worn over an Underarmor Suit (p.87). \n\n Each piece of Scout Armor other than the mask can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. Scout Armor Masks cannot be modded. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). All Scout Armor Material mods are installed with the Repair skill. It is considered sturdy armor."
