name: "Chinese Stealth Armor"
desc: "This dark black, form-fitting bodysuit with an opaque faceplate is a suit of armor designed for one thing: making the operator nigh-invisible. Harnessing Chinese expertise in stealth technology, the suit contains a portable device that generates a modulating field that transmits the reflected light from one side of an object to another. The result is near-perfect active camouflage. The bodysuit is designed to maximize the effect by simplifying the wearer’s silhouette and creating flat surfaces where possible to reduce the complexity of the area being camouflaged. Deployed under the designation Hēi Guĭ, the suit was worn by the elite “Black Ghost” counterinsurgency and terror units, it allowed China to counter American brute force with subterfuge and deception, although some units were captured and reverse engineered by the Americans, resulting in the development of the Stealth Boy. \n\n **Special:** While wearing this armor, you may reroll 1d20 on any Sneak test. In addition, you may activate its stealth field by taking the Interact minor action. While active, this field renders you and your equipment almost invisible. Enemies add +2 to the difficulty of all tests to spot you; they may still hear you or notice your presence in other ways. In addition, even if you have been detected, while invisible, your defense is increased by +2. Making an attack disrupts the stealth field, shutting it down until you can reactivate it. \n\n A Chinese Stealth Armor cannot be given any mods. It is considered light armor."
