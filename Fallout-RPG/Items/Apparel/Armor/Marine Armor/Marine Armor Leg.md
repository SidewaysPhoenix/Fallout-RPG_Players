name: "Marine Armor Leg"
desc: "A specialized form of combat armor favored by the United States Marine Corps before the Great War, providing considerable protection at the cost of great weight. It is commonly worn over a Marine Wetsuit, allowing for aquatic and amphibious assaults. \n\n Each piece of Marine armor other than helmets can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. Marine Armor helmets may only accept a Material mod. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). All Marine Armor Material mods are installed with the Repair skill. It is considered heavy armor."
