name: "Sturdy Robot Armor Arm"
desc: "Not to be confused with armor made for robots, robot armor is a collection of armor pieces made from robots. It’s typically bulkier than metal armor, but provides slightly superior protection. It’s commonly produced by tech-savvy raider groups, such as the Rust Devils who appear in the Commonwealth. Helmets are often the repurposed outer shells of eyebots, Assaultron heads, or sentry bot heads. \n\n Each piece of Robot armor other than helmets can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. Robot Armor helmets may only accept a Material mod. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). All Robot Armor Material mods are installed with the Repair skill."
