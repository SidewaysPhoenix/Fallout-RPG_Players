desc: "All armor worn by Caesar's Legion adhere to the uniformity and military principles of ancient Rome that the Legion is modeled upon. \n\n The most basic form of Legion armor consists of sports equipment with a few scrap additions for protection. You can easily tell a legionaries rank by the additions they make to their armor, adding trophies won in battle to the point where the average Centurion will sport at least one piece of Power Armor and a super mutant helmet. Further proving their prowess by wearing these items without the aid of an armor frame or the supermutants FEV enhanced muscles. \n\n All Legion Armor Material mods are installed with the **Repair** skill. Legionary Recruit and Legionary armor are considered light armor, Legionary Centurion armor is considered heavy armor."
