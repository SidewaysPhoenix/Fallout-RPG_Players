name: "Wood Armor Arm"
desc: "Wood armor is constructed from multiple large sections of tree bark and rope, fashioned into a crude set of armor. Some portions, mainly the torso, have rusted tin cans affixed to it as if to act as makeshift pockets. Small collections of dead lichen dot the exterior of the armor. It offers poor resistance against physical damage, and marginal resistance to energy damage. \n\n Each piece of Wood armor can accept a Material mod, listed below. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost. All Wood Armor Material mods are installed with the Repair skill. It is considered light armor."
