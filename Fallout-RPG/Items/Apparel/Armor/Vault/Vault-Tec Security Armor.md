name: "Vault-Tec Security Armor"
desc: "Consisting of a long bulletproof apron and shoulder pads, plus an accompanying shock-resistant helmet, this armor was issued in small quantities to every vault for those vault-dwellers chosen to act as security personnel. It provides modest protection and isn’t especially bulky, but it is unlikely to stand up to heavy combat, simply because vaults were expected to be controlled environments, lacking in the heavy armaments found outside."
