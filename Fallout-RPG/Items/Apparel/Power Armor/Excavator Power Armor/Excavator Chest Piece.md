desc: "Developed by Garrahan Mining Co., the EXC-17 Excavator suit was designed to protect miners from rockfalls and airborne contaminants while increasing the speed at which they could work. Although it had never reached full commercial production, the unit garnered fame during an ad campaign in which it was marketed as the future of Appalachian mining, appealing to anti-automation mining teams and other prospective clients. Prototype suits, and post-war versions created from scavenged schematics, can be found scattered across the Wasteland. \n\n **Special:** A character wearing a full suit of Excavator Power Armor—a chest piece, both arms, both legs, and a helmet—increases their carry weight by 100. In addition, when extracting ore (see sidebar), each Excavator Arm piece worn adds +2 D6 to the quantity of ore found, for a maximum of +4 D6 with both arms. \n\n Each piece of Excavator power armor can accept the normal system mods, on p.144 of the **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**."

##### Mining and Excavation

At times, you may encounter mineral deposits in rocky outcroppings, within caves, and mine workings across the Wastelands, especially in locations such as Appalachia, where mining was a major industry before the War. 

Ore is an additional item category that can be found in scavenging locations, though outside of mines and caves, the maximum amount of Ore rolls that can be made is 0. Where Ore can be found, roll on the Ore table below to determine what you receive, and how much. Each unit of Ore found weighs 1lb, but cannot be sold.

| D20   | Ore Found    | Quantity Found | Salvage                   |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1-3   | Aluminum Ore | 2+3D6          | 1 Aluminum (Uncommon)     |
| 4-7   | Coal         | 1+2D6          | 1 Coal (Uncommon)         |
| 8-10  | Copper Ore   | 2+3D6          | 1 Copper (Uncommon)       |
| 11    | Crystal      | 2+3D6          | 1 Crystal (Rare)          |
| 12    | Gold Ore     | 1+2D6          | 1 Gold (Rare)             |
| 13-16 | Iron Ore     | 3+4D6          | 2D6 Iron (Common)         |
| 17-19 | Silver Ore   | 1+2D6          | 1 Silver (Uncommon)       |
| 20    | Uranium Ore  | 1+1D6          | 1 Nuclear Material (Rare) | 

The Salvage column in the table above indicates what materials—and how many of those materials—are produced by smelting the ore at a Chemistry Station. Smelting requires a **INT + Science** test with a difficulty of 1, and smelts an amount of ore equal to your Science skill, +1 for each AP spent. Each unit of ore smelted costs one unit of Acid (uncommon material). Coal is the exception to this: you don’t find coal ore, just coal (common material).
