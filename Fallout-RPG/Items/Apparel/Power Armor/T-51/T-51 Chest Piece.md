desc: "The T-51b was the most advanced Power Armor in wide-scale use before the outbreak of the Great War. First seeing service, and inherently, great success, in the Anchorage Reclamation campaign, the T-51 Power Armor soon became standard issue for the army’s armored infantry regiments. The T-51 was the peak of pre-War Power Armor technology, deployed widely enough that it can still be found centuries later in the wastelands. \n\n Constructed of a polylaminate composite, the outer shell of T-51 armor is surprisingly lightweight and features an ablative silver alloy coating which refracts and dissipates laser emissions efficiently. \n\n Each piece of T-51 Power Armor can accept three mods: an upgrade mod, one plating mod, and a system. All Unique T-51 Power Armor Upgrade Mods are installed with the Repair Skill."
