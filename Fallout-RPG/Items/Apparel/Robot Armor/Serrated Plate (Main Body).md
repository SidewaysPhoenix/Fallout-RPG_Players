name: "Serrated Plate"
desc: "Makeshift armor plating with jagged, serrated edges. Like primal plate, but more hazardous to those who would do the robot ill, as the sharp protrusions can lead to injury. \n\n **Special:** When a melee attack is made against a location fitted with serrated plate, and the attacker suffers a complication, then the attacker suffers 2D6 [[Persistent]] (Physical) damage. In addition, melee attacks made using arms fitted with serrated plate gain the [[Persistent]] (Physical) damage effect."
