name: "Brotherhood of Steel Fatigues"
desc: "A set of basic, hard-wearing gear for Brotherhood of Steel personnel, consisting of a military sweater, pants, gloves, combat boots, and military webbing, and emblazoned with Brotherhood insignia denoting rank and role. The color of the uniform also denotes certain specializations: medics wear a version with a white sweater, while flight personnel wear navy blue. Though not intended for use in combat, these fatigues are hardwearing and resilient enough to provide a little protection against hazards."
