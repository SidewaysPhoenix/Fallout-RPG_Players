name: "Formal Clothing"
desc: "A nice suit, a pretty dress, or some other kind of fancy, tailored clothing. Designed to be more flattering than functional, formal clothing is helpful when you need to impress someone, and is often prized as a sign of status, presenting the appearance of someone who doesn’t need to worry about their own safety. \n\n **Special:** Wearing formal clothing allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one **CHA**-based skill test you make each scene, as the clothing helps you make a good first impression. \n\n Formal clothing can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave."
