desc: "A finely made, comfortable, and highly stylized vision of a commander from ancient Rome, this outfit affords some of the gravitas and power of Caesar, allowing the wearer to more easily threaten and scare anyone who knows of the atrocities the Legion has committed in Caesar’s name. \n\n **Special:** The reputation of Caesar has spread far and wide, anyone wearing this armor may re-roll 1d20 on Speech tests aimed to threaten or scare."
