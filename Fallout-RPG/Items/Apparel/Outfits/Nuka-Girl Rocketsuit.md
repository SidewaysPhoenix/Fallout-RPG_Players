name: "Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit"
desc: "This costume, modeled on the mascot of the NukaCola brand, was released nationwide to retailers in time for Halloween 2062, and was highly sought-after. \n\n **Special:** Wearing this costume allows you to reroll 1d20 on one **CHA**-based test you make each scene, as it helps make a good first impression. The sealable [[Spacesuit Helmet]] built into the costume allows you to breathe underwater or in any other place where the atmosphere isn’t breathable."
