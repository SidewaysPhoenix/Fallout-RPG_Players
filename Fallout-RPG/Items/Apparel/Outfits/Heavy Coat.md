desc: "A long, heavy-weight coat—a leather duster, a trench￾coat, or similar—ideal for protecting you from the harsh elements. Provides a bit of protection against physical harm, extreme heat, and even covers well enough to keep a little radiation out. \n\n **Special:** Wearing a heavy coat allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one **END**-based skill test you make each scene, as it helps protect you from harsh conditions. \n\n A heavy coat can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave"
