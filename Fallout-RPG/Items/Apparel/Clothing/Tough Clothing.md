desc: "Hard-wearing clothing cobbled together from sufficiently sturdy garments to create an outfit that can withstand a hard life in the wasteland. Normally made from a jacket, a shirt and undershirt, a pair of jeans, and some walking boots, reinforced (or patched) with duct tape, to provide both a little protection against the bumps and scrapes of life and a bit of warmth on those cold nuclear winter nights."
