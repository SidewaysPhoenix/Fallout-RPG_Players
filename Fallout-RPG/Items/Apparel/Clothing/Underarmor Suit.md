This outfit comes in several color schemes, suitable for different environments such as forest, urban, winter, and so forth. \n\n **Special:** Wearing an underarmor suit allows you to reroll 1d20 on one STR or PER based test you attempt each scene. \n\n Underarmor suits may be fitted with an additional protective lining, taking one of the mods below.
