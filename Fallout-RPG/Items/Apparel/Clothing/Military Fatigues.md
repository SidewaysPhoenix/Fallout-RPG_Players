name: "Military Fatigues"
desc: "A simple, hard-wearing shirt, jacket, pants, and set of combat boots designed to be worn by military personnel before the Great War. These garments are designed to be worn in unpleasant conditions, and have numerous pockets for carrying useful items, so an intact set is a decent find. \n\n **Special:** Wearing military fatigues allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one **STR** or **AGI** based skill test you make each scene, as the fatigues are easy to move in. \n\n Military fatigues can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave."
