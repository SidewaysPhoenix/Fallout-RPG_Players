The U.S. Covert Operations Manual is a training handbook produced by the Department of the Army to train its personnel in the art of subterfuge. The manuals were not intended for public circulation and were marked “Authorized Eyes Only.” This hasn’t stopped them being found, read, and scattered across the wastelands. 

* **Perk:** Depending on the individual issue found, you receive a different perk, which you may benefit from once. If you later learn the perk, you may use that benefit once per scene. Roll to determine the issue found:
