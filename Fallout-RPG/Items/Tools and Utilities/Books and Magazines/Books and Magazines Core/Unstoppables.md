Together, they form the titular Unstoppables. The cover art for the magazine depicts imagery highlighting the heroes, villains, and the adventure of each issue. 

* **Perk:** Depending on the individual issue found, you receive a different perk, allowing you to spend Luck points to avoid a single instance of damage, which you may benefit from once. If you later learn the perk, you may use that benefit as often as you have Luck points to spend on it. Roll to determine the issue found:
