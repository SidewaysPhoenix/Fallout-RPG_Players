Books and magazines are old pre-War publications which provided information and entertainment to the masses. In the wasteland, they’re a useful source of forgotten or rare information. 

When you discover a book or magazine during looting or when trading with someone else, roll to determine which publication it is. 

All books and magazines have a Weight of <1, a Cost of 100, and a Rarity of 3. 

* Perks: When you read a magazine, it grants a temporary perk, a bonus which applies once, normally on a single skill test, a single attack, or other distinct situation. If you have the Comprehension perk (p.62) you have a chance to use the benefit again. Once you used a temporary perk, you may choose to learn it permanently when you next level up; otherwise, you forget it and must find another copy of that magazine to ‘remind’ yourself of the perk.
