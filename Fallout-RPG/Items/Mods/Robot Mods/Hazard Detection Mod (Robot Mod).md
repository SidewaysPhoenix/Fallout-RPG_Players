desc: "Developed for cheap, disposable trap-clearance robots to accompany soldiers in enemy territory, this hazard detection and analysis system modifies the robot’s sensory awareness to identify and categorize potential environmental threats and hazards. Repurposed for the Miss Nanny to spot dangers to children in the household, the system’s developers never fully removed the urge to go towards hazards to investigate them more closely."
