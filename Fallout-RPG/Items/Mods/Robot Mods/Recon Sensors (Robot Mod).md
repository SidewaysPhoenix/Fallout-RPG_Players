desc: "Designed to aid with target acquisition and patrol efficiency in Mister Gutsy military robots, these recon sensors allow the robot to not only detect foes more easily (and more quickly determine friend from foe, after a number of early friendly-fire incidents) but also to track and predict the movements of enemies who were no longer visible, making it harder for enemies to escape."
