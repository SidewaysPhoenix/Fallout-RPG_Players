desc: "A standard part of the domestic model Mister Handy, the internal boiler was to be used to provide hot tea and coffee in the morning for the robot’s owners, as well as a ready source of hot water for food preparation and household cleaning purposes. Post-War, Mister Handy units with a functional boiler are sought-after companions, as thoroughly boiling water is one way to clean it and make it safe to drink. A self-cleaning mechanism keeps it from becoming contaminated between uses, though this does take some time to work."
