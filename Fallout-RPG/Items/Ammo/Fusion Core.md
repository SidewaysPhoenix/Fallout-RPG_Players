desc: "Pre-War fusion cores are high-grade, long-term nuclear batteries. A single core can power a small building for a long time or provide a lot of power for something very quickly. Most suits of Power Armor accept a fusion core power source, which lasts for several hours of activity. They can also be used as the ammunition supply for a [[Gatling laser]]. \n\n When discovered, a fusion core contains a number of charges equal to 10 plus the user’s Science skill (people with more scientific knowledge can utilize the power more efficiently; the Nuclear Physicist perk also adds extra charges, see p.68 Core Rulebook). How these charges are used or depleted depends on what they’re plugged into (see Power Armor, p.123 Core Rulebook). \n\n When used as the ammunition for a [[Gatling laser]], each charge a fusion core contains translates to 50 shots for a [[Gatling laser]]. As a Gatling weapon, the [[Gatling laser]] consumes ammunition ten times as quickly as most weapon (see Gatling, p.90 Core Rulebook). \n\n The Scavenger perk cannot increase the number of fusion cores found."
