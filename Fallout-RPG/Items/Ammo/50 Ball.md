desc: "50 caliber ball ammunition is a half-inch lead ball used in muzzleloading weapons such as old-fashioned muskets. A separate charge of black gunpowder must also be loaded, as this old-timey ammunition doesn’t contain its own propellant. \n\n **Special:** In game terms, the need to provide gunpowder alongside .50 ball ammunition is ignored – assume that, whenever you find .50 ball ammunition, you find an appropriate amount of gunpowder too.
