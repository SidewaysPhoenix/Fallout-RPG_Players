desc: "Large, high-powered, high-performance rounds used only in the most powerful rifles. These rounds were normally used for heavy machine guns and anti-materiel rifles pre-War, so supplies of them tend to be scarce unless there’s a military base nearby. A shot from one of these will make a mess of anything it hits, but you need to make every shot count"
