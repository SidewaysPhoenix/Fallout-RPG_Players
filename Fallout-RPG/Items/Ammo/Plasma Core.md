rarity: "5"
desc: "Like the smaller plasma cartridges, these devices combine power supply and fuel: each one contains both a compact, specialized fusion core, and a reservoir of the chemical which is transformed into the plasma that the weapon fires. Plasma cores are exclusively used by the [[Gatling Plasma]], and each one contains 500 shots for that weapon. Note that, as a [[Gatling Plasma]] is a Gatling weapon, it consumes ammunition at ten times the normal rate. \n\n The Scrounger perk cannot increase the number of Plasma Cores found."
