desc: "Compact high-explosive rockets designed to be launched from a missile launcher. They are capable of steering to a target under control from a guidance system, if the launcher has one, which means that makeshift rockets won’t work in their place. \n\n When found by a character with the Scavenger perk, roll only +1D6 per Rank, rather than the normal bonus amount."
