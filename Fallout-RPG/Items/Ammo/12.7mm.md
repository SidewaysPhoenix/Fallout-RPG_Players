desc: "The Hauer Premium Show Stopper 12.7mm civic defense round is a large pistol round. In essence, these rounds consist of a big flat bullet in a straight case, with a rebated rim. \n\n While they have an identical bullet diameter to the .50 caliber rifle round, the much smaller case means it holds less powder and can be safely used in man-portable auto-loading weapons."
