desc: "Smaller than a conventional hand grenade, but comparably lethal, a 40mm grenade is designed to be launched from most common grenade launchers, allowing them to be fired with reasonable accuracy over long distances. \n\n When found by a character with the Scavenger perk, roll only +1 D6 per Rank, rather than the normal bonus amount"
