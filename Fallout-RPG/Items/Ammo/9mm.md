desc: "Before the Great War, 9mm was the preferred type of ammunition for small weapons in the American Southwest, while the military and the Eastern and Western Seaboards tended to favor the more powerful 10mm ammunition. 9mm ammunition is lightweight and widely available, but has a reputation for being insufficiently deadly"
