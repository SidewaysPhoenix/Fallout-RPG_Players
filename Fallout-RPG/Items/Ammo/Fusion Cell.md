desc: "A microfusion cell—or fusion cell—is a miniaturized fusion reactor used in light energy weapons. They use volatile hydrogen isotopes which undergo fusion when subjected to extreme heat and pressure, and they can explode if exposed to a significant external heat source. Difficult to refuel without the proper facilities, these cells are often simply disposed of when depleted. \n\n When fusion cell ammunition is found, it is in the form of a single cell containing the number of shots generated."
