desc: "A small tube like a shotgun cartridge, containing a chemical which burns brightly when ignited. Fired from a flare gun, which ignites a fuse upon launching: the flare shoots up into the sky, illuminating the area around it and then drifting down on a plume of white smoke. Good for signaling for help, not for much else."
