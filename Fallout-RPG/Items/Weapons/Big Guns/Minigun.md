type: "Big Guns"
desc: "The minigun is a motorized Gatling-style rapid fire weapon commonly employed by the military, or other lesser factions that managed to acquire such a weapon. Miniguns can be found as mounted door guns on Vertibirds or as a handheld heavy assault and support weapon. The high rate-of-fire of the weapon means that it can produce devastating results, but at a cost of consuming ammo at incredible rates, making it difficult to keep the weapon supplied. \n\n A Minigun can accept one each of the following mods, which are unique to the minigun and installed with the Repair skill: \n* **Barrel:** [[Accelerated Barrel]], [[Tri-Barrel (Minigun)|Tri-Barrel]] \n* **Sights:** [[Gunner Sight (Minigun)|Gunner Sight]] \n* **Muzzle Mod:** [[Shredder]]"
