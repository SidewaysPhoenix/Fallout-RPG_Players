desc: "The Gauss Minigun is a powerful, automatic ballistic weapon that rapidly fires hypervelocity 2mm rounds that deal devastating damage. Given their scarce ammunition and the sheer rate of fire it possesses— particularly when modified—this is a powerful weapon that demands a wealthy and well-supplied owner. It can even be fitted with a Tesla coil, charging rounds with electricity as they’re fired. \n\n A Gatling Gun can accept the following unique mods: \n* **Barrel:** [[Tri-Barrel (Gauss Minigun)|Tri-Barrel]], [[Penta-Barrel]] \n* **Tesla Coil:** [[Tesla Coil Capacitor]], [[Tesla Coil Dynamo]] \n* **Sight:** [[Gunner Sight (Gauss Minigun)|Gunner Sight]]"
