type: "Big Guns"
desc: "A high rate-of-fire laser weapon, the Gatling laser uses several rotating barrels fired in quick succession to produce a devastating fusillade of laser pulses. While the individual laser pulses lack in stopping power, the sheer mass of them can wear down almost any target. Gatling lasers can operate from any sufficient power source, and while fusion cells can be used to power them, the rate-of-fire means that they are often quickly expended. Most users instead rely on a larger power source, such as a fusion core. \n\n A Gatling laser can accept one each of the following mods which are installed with the Science skill. These resemble some common Energy Weapon mods, but somewhat larger and slightly different in effect due to the Gatling laser’s size. \n* **Capacitor:** [[Photon Exciter (Gatling Laser)|Photon Exciter]], [[Beta Wave Tuner (Gatling Laser)|Beta Wave Tuner]], [[Boosted Capacitor (Gatling Laser)|Boosted Capacitor]], [[photon agitator (Gatling Laser)|Photon Agitator]], [[Gamma Wave Emitter (Gatling Laser)|Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Maximized Capacitor (Gatling Laser)|Maximized Capacitor]], [[Boosted Photon Agitator (Gatling Laser)|Boosted Photon Agitator]], [[Boosted Gamma Wave Emitter (Gatling Laser)|Boosted Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Overcharged Capacitor (Gatling Laser)|Overcharged Capacitor]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Charging Barrels]] \n* **Sight:** [[reflex sight (gatling laser)|Reflex Sight]] \n* **Nozzle:** [[Beam Focuser (Gatling Laser)|Beam Focuser]]"
