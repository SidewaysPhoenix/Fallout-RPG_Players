type: "Big Guns"
desc: "Originally referred to as “Gatling’s battery gun”, these weapons resemble an old-fashioned version of a minigun, with the rotating barrels operated by a hand-crank rather than an electric motor. Naturally, this means that it has a slower rate of fire than its more advanced counterpart, but the weapon is no less functional for its old-fashioned design. \n\n A Gatling Gun can accept the following unique mods: \n* **Receiver:** [[Speedy Receiver]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Long Barrel (Gatling Gun)|Long Barrel]] \n* **Grip:** [[Comfort Grip (Gatling Gun)|Comfort Grip]] \n* **Magazine:** [[Extra-Large Magazine (Gatling Gun )|Extra-Large Magazine]] \n* **Sight:** [[Front Sight Ring (Gatling Gun)|Front Sight Ring]] \n* **Muzzle:** [[Large Bayonet]] "
