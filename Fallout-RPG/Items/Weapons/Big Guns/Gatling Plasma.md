type: "Big Guns"
desc: "An evolution of plasma gun technology, the gatling plasma is a rare, potent, and costly weapon to use. Like smaller weapons of its kind, it inflicts damage through a combination of both physical impact and thermal transfer, and like other gatling weaponry, it inflicts this damage via a rapid-firing collection of rotating barrels that spray huge numbers of shots at the enemy. The relative scarcity of plasma cartridges, or extremely rare plasma cores, and the rate at which this weapon consumes ammunition, means that keeping the weapon supplied for use can be a full-time job. \n\n **Special:** Plasma weapons inflict both Physical and Energy damage. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by whichever of the target’s damage resistances is lower out of Physical or Energy. \n\n A Gatling Plasma can accept the following unique mods: \n* **Barrel:** [[Ported Barrel (Gatling Plasma)|Ported Barrel]] \n* **Grip:** [[Comfort Grip (Gatling Plasma)|Comfort Grip]] \n* **Sight:** [[Reflex Sight (Gatling Plasma)|Reflex Sight]] \n* **Nozzle:** [[Beam Splitter (Gatling Plasma)|Beam Splitter]], [[Beam Focuser (Gatling Plasma)|Beam Focuser]]"
