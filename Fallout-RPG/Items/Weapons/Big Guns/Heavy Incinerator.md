desc: "Like a flamethrower, a heavy incinerator also propels ignited fuel mixtures to burn a target. However, the heavy incinerator differs in that it appears to lob a succession of fireballs at the target, lobbing them in an arc like a grenade launcher. These fireballs burst upon impact, spreading flames as the fuel splashes off the target."
