type: "Explosives"
desc: "These non-lethal grenades are designed to disorient enemies rather than inflict direct harm: when they detonate, they produce a blinding flash and a deafening bang—hence the name—which leaves enemies reeling and vulnerable, but otherwise unharmed, though they’re unlikely to remain unharmed for long while they’re stunned by a flash bang. \n\n **Special:** If a flash bang hits, any character caught within the blast of a Flash Bang is stunned, as per the [[Stun]] damage effect. If the grenade misses, there is no effect."
