type: "Explosives"
desc: "Smoke grenades are used as both signaling devices and to provide concealment. A chemical reaction of different agents, when mixed and ignited, produce either colored smoke as a signaling device, or a dense cloud of chemical smoke to screen for concealment. \n\n **Special:** When a smoke grenade detonates, it generates a cloud of smoke which fills the affected zone. Characters cannot see while within the cloud, nor can they see into or through the cloud from outside it, adding +2 difficulty to all attacks and **PER**-based tests made by or against anyone within the cloud. The cloud dissipates over time; at the end of each round, roll 1 D6, plus +1 D6 for each round the cloud has persisted: if one or more Effects are rolled, the cloud has dispersed enough to no longer have an effect."
