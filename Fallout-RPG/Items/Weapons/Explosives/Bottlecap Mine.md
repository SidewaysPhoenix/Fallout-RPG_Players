type: "Explosives"
desc: "The Bottlecap mine is crudely put together, yet a formidable explosive. Bottlecap mines are constructed from a simple container such as a lunchbox, filled with bottle caps and a crude explosive mixture, and fitted with a sensor and a detonator. The explosive force hurls the caps over a wide area at such speed that they are essentially shrapnel \n\n **Special:** when constructing a Bottlecap mine, you may add extra bottlecaps; every 10 caps added increases the damage by +1D6. When the mine detonates, roll the damage rating a second time: the total rolled is the number of intact caps found in the zone where the mine detonated."
