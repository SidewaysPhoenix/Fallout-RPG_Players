desc: "A canister containing chemicals which are rapidly transformed into superheated ionized gas—or plasma—upon detonation. The blast of a plasma grenade generates vast amounts of heat which more than makes up for the lack of shrapnel or concussive shockwaves. \n\n Special: Plasma grenades inflict both physical and energy damage. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by whichever of the target’s damage resistances is lower out of Physical or Energy."
