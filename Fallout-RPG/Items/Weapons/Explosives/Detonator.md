type: "Explosives"
desc: "Appearing as something like a pistol grip with a trigger and a short antenna, a detonator allows placed explosives to be triggered remotely. \n\n **Special:** When a [[Placed]] explosive is being placed, if you have a Detonator, you may choose to have the explosive triggered remotely. This removes the [[Delay]] (X) Trait and means that you may detonate that explosive device as a minor action at any point during the scene, so long as you are within Long range of the explosive. You may attempt to have multiple explosives set to detonate using the same detonator, but the difficulty of the **PER + Explosives** test to set the explosives increases by +1 for each subsequent bomb linked to the detonator. When the detonator is used, all linked explosives detonate at the same time."
