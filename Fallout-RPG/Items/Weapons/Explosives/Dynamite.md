desc: "A simple explosive, dynamite is a pressed stick of absorbent clay or similar material soaked in nitroglycerine. Sticks of dynamite are a compact and relatively cheap and stable form of explosive that isn’t too difficult to make. Storing it for long periods, however, can be risky, as old dynamite will often ‘sweat’ nitroglycerine, so old stockpiles of dynamite should be handled with care. \n\n Dynamite is often found as single sticks, which can be thrown individually like grenades, or bundled together with a timer as a placed bomb. \n\n **Special:** Single sticks of dynamite are assumed to have a short fuse, which will detonate the same turn they’re lit (and thrown), functioning like a normal grenade. A character may prepare longer fuses for dynamite, requiring a **PER + Explosives** test with a difficulty of 1: success means you prepare one stick of dynamite with a longer fuse, plus one additional stick per AP spent. Long-fuse dynamite has the [[Delay]] (X) quality, with a rating set at the time the longer fuses are prepared. \n\n Dynamite bundles have the [[Delay]] (X) quality, with the rating set when the bomb is placed."
