desc: "By default many robots, from the rare robobrain to the Protectron, are equipped with claws to facilitate their work and help interact with their environment. Rather a design principal than a PR or marketing consideration, claws were time and again decided to be more useful and efficient than attempting to model the human hand, and so robotic hands often feature 2 to 3 individual claws rather than 5 ‘fingers’. A claw can accept the following mods, which are installed using the Repair skill: \n* Claw: [[Shock Mod]], [[Stun Mod]]"
