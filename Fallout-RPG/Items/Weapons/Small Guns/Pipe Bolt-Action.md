desc: "A makeshift weapon, normally seen in the hands of those who can’t make, buy, or scavenge anything better, pipe guns are crude and somewhat unreliable, but effective enough. Bolt-action pipe guns tend to be chambered for rifle caliber rounds, trading rate-of-fire for power and simplicity. \n\n A Pipe Bolt-Action can accept one each of the following mods. You may not take both a Grip and a Stock Mod. Any Stock mods add the word “Rifle” to the end of the weapon’s name. \n* **Receiver:** [[Calibrated]], [[Hardened]], [[Powerful]], .[[38 Receiver]], .[[50 Receiver]], [[Calibrated Powerful Receiver]] \n* Barrel: [[Long Barrel]], [[Ported Barrel]], [[Finned Barrel]] \n* **Grip:** [[Sharpshooter’s Grip]] \n* **Stock:** [[Full Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock]], [[Recoil-Compensating Stock]] \n* **Sights:** [[Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope]], [[Long Scope]], [[Short Night Vision Scope]], [[Long Night Vision Scope]], [[Recon Scope]] \n* **Muzzle:** [[Bayonet]],[[Compensator]], [[Muzzle Brake]], [[Suppressor]]"
