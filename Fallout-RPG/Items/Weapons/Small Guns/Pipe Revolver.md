desc: "Like the other forms of pipe gun, the pipe revolver is a makeshift or homemade gun, in this case modelled aftera revolver. It strikes a balance between the stopping power of the pipe bolt–action, and the fire rate of the pipe gun, and its improvised nature makes it similarly suited for modification. \n\n A Pipe Revolver can accept one each of the following mods. Any Stock mods add “Rifle” to the end of the weapon’s name. \n* **Receiver:** [[Calibrated]], [[Hardened]], [[Powerful]], .[[38 Receiver]], .[[308 Receiver]], [[Calibrated Powerful Receiver]], .[[357 Receiver]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Long Barrel]], [[Ported Barrel]], [[Finned Barrel]] \n* **Grip:** [[Sharpshooter’s Grip]] \n* **Stock:** [[Full Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock]], [[Recoil-Compensating Stock]] \n* **Sights:** [[Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope]], [[Long Scope]], [[Short Night Vision Scope]], [[Long Night Vision Scope]], [[Recon Scope]] \n* **Muzzle:** [[Bayonet]], [[Compensator]], [[Muzzle Brake]], [[Suppressor]]"
