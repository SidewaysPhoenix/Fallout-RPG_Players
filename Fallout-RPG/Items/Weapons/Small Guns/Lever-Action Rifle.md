desc: "As the name suggests, a lever-action rifle uses a lever to cycle the weapon’s action; this is typically part of the trigger guard, allowing the shooter to cycle the action with minimal effort or movement. Though this slows the rate of fire, it’s a reliable design that stands up to use, time, and nuclear war. \n* **Receiver:** [[Calibrated]], [[Hardened]], [[Powerful]], [[Advanced]], [[Calibrated Powerful Receiver]], .[[357 Receiver]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Long Barrel]], [[Ported Barrel]] \n* **Stock:** [[Full Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock]] \n* **Sights:** [[Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope]], [[Long Scope]], [[Short Night Vision Scope]], [[Long Night Vision Scope]] \n* **Muzzle:** [[Suppressor]]"
