Not as potent as the feared and respected .44 revolver, these guns remain scattered around parts of the Wasteland due to their common use by police forces as service weapons and due to their extremely simple, durable build that makes them easy to maintain and extremely reliable. \n * **Receiver:** [[Hair Trigger]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Long Barrel]] \n* **Magazine:** [[Large Magazine]]"
