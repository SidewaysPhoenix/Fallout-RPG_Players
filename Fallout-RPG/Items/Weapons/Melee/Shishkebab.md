desc: "A makeshift “flaming sword”, the Shishkebab is found in various forms across the wastelands, with some versions being built around actual swords, while others are constructed from a variety of components. They all have a few common elements, however: some form of fuel tank or canister (either affixed to the weapon itself, or worn by the wielder and connected by a hose), a pilot light, and a triggering mechanism normally salvaged from a motorcycle. During use, the fuel is released along the blade and ignited by the pilot light, wreathing the blade in flames. \n\n A Shishkebab can accept the following mod which is installed with the Repair skill: \n* [[Extra Flame Jets (Shishkebab)|Extra Flame Jets]]"
