name: "Ballistic Fist"
type: "Unarmed"
desc: "**Ammunition:** Shotgun Shells \n\n The ballistic fist consists of a wrist-mounted shotgun with a pressure plate worn over the knuckles. The impact of the plate triggers the firing mechanism when a punch connects with the target, firing the shotgun directly into the target, with brutal effect. \n\n **Special:** This melee weapon requires ammunition, expending one shotgun shell with each attack. Due to the [[Slow Load]] quality, it must be reloaded as a minor action before it can be used again: without a shotgun shell, a ballistic fist simply makes a normal unarmed attack."
