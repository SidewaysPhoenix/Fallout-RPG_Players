desc: "Swords have been in use for almost as long as wars have been fought and remained widespread as symbols of status and prestige amongst soldiers—particularly officers—across the world right up until the Great War. Many of the swords found in the wastelands are those used by Chinese officers during the Great War, often taken from battlefields as a trophy by American troops. Others are museum pieces or replicas from private collections, with many resembling the cavalry sabers used during the American Revolution. \n\n Swords can accept one of the following mods which are installed with the Repair skill: \n* [[Serrated Blade (Sword)|Serrated Blade]]\n* [[Electrified Blade (Sword)|Electrified Blade]]\n* [[Electrified Serrated Blade (Sword)|Electrified Serrated Blade]]\n* [[Stun Pack (Sword)|Stun Pack]]"
