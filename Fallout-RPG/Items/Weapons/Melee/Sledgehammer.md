Although not usually considered as a powerful weapon, a strong person—or a super mutant—can wield one of these like a club, taking full advantage of the hammer’s weight. \n\n A sledgehammer can accept one of the following mods which are installed with the Repair skill: \n* [[Puncturing (Sledgehammer)|Puncturing]]\n* [[Heavy (Sledgehammer)|Heavy]]"
