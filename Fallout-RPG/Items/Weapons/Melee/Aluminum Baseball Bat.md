desc: "Baseball bats were once used in the sport of baseball, considered America’s number-one pastime during the pre-War era. Two hundred years later, they have been re-purposed as crude but effective melee weapons. While most are made a single piece of wood—normally ash, but other hardwoods are often used—a few can be found made of aluminum instead, making for a lighter, harder bat. \n\n A baseball bat can accept one of the following mods which are installed with the Repair skill. You may only apply mods to an aluminum baseball bat if you have the Blacksmith 1 perk. \n* [[Barbed (Baseball Bat)|Barbed]]\n* [[Spiked (Baseball Bat)|Spiked]]\n* [[Sharp (Baseball Bat)|Sharp]]\n* [[Chain-Wrapped (Baseball Bat)|Chain-Wrapped]]\n* [[Bladed (Baseball Bat)|Bladed]]"
