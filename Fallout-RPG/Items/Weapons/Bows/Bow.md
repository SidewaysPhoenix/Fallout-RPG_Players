desc: "Bows are a distinct weapon type, and do not fall into any of the existing weapon categories. Ranged attacks using a Bow weapon are made with an AGI + Athletics test. Bows cannot be used by characters wearing Power Armor. \n\n A simple recurve bow, with a modest draw weight. While primitive, a bow has numerous advantages: the weapon is lightweight, ammunition can be made more easily than bullets, and shooting a bow (archery experts will insist that you don’t fire a bow) is almost silent. Arrows can be produced with a variety of different effects as well, which makes for a versatile weapon. \n\n A bow can accept one each of the following mods, which are unique to bows and installed with the **Survival** skill: \n* Frame: [[Compound Frame]] \n* Sight: [[Iron Sights]], [[Glow Sights]]"
