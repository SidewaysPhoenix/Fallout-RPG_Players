desc: "This firefighting tool installed on firefighter Protectrons fires cryogenic spray that rapidly cools any fires the Protectron is trying to put out, or in another emergency be used as a self-defense mechanism. Prolonged exposure to its jets can result in freezing of organic materials—even living creatures! \n\n **Special:** Cryojets are integrated into the arms of robots and therefore can’t be used as a handheld weapon."
