desc: "The alien blaster is sometimes referred to as an alien blaster pistol based on its physical appearance mimicking the small firearms designed on Earth. Meant to be held in one hand where the index or middle finger could fit around the trigger, this weapon is capable of using the unique alien energy like a laser gun uses fusion cells. \n\n **Special:** Alien blasters inflict both Energy and Radiation damage. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by which ever of the target’s damage resistances is lower out of Energy or Radiation. A creature that is killed by an alien blaster is instead vaporized and reduced to ash. \n\n The default profile is for an alien pistol. An alien blaster can accept one each of the following mods. Any Stock mods change the weapon to an Alien Rifle. \n\n An alien blaster can accept one each of the following mods (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.104): \n* Barrel: [[Bracketed Short Barrel]], [[Long Barrel (Energy Weapons)|Long Barrel]], [[Automatic Barrel]], [[Bracketed Long Barrel]], [[Improved Barrel]], [[Sniper Barrel]] \n* Grip: [[Sharpshooter’s Grip (Energy)|Sharpshooter’s Grip]] \n* Stock: [[Standard Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock (Energy Weapons)|Marksman’s Stock]] \n* Sights: [[Reflex Sight (Energy Weapons)|Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope (Energy Weapons)|Short Scope]] \n\n An alien blaster can accept one each of the following mods, which are unique to alien blaster and installed with the Science skill: \n* Magazine: [[Fusion Mag]]"
