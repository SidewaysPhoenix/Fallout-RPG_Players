desc: "Laser guns are high-tech weapons which emit a concentrated beam of coherent, directional light, intense enough to inflict serious damage. They were a relatively new development in the years before the Great War, and thus are not an especially common sight in the wasteland, outside of those groups who’ve secured old military weapons caches. Most surviving models of laser gun—such as the dependable AER9, widely used by the U. S. Army—use an internal capacitor charged by a microfusion power cell. \n\n The default profile is for a laser pistol. A laser gun can accept one each of the following mods. Any Stock mods change the weapon to a laser rifle. \n* **Capacitor:** [[Photon Exciter]], [[Beta Wave Tuner]], [[Boosted Capacitor]], [[Photon Agitator]], [[Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Maximized Capacitor]], [[Boosted Photon Agitator]], [[Boosted Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Overcharged Capacitor]] \n* **Barrel:** [[long barrel (energy weapons)|Long Barrel]], [[Automatic Barrel]], [[Sniper Barrel]], [[Improved Barrel]], [[Improved Long Barrel]], [[Improved Automatic Barrel]], [[Improved Sniper Barrel]] \n* **Grip:** [[Sharpshooter’s Grip (Energy)|Sharpshooter’s Grip]] \n* **Stock:** [[Standard Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock (Energy Weapons)|Marksman's Stock]], [[Recoil Compensating Stock (Energy Weapons)|Recoil Compensating Stock]] \n* **Sights:** [[Reflex Sight (Energy Weapons)|Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope (Energy Weapons)|Short Scope]], [[Long Scope (Energy Weapons)|Long Scope]], [[Short Night Vision Scope  (Energy Weapons)|Short Night Vision Scope]], [[Long Night Vision Scope (Energy Weapons)|Long Night Vision Scope]], [[Recon Scope (Energy Weapons)|Recon Scope]] \n* **Muzzle:** [[Beam Splitter]], [[Beam Focuser]], [[Gyro Compensating Lens]], [[Amplified Beam Splitter]], [[Fine-Tuned Beam Focuser]], [[Quantum Gyro-Compensating Lens]]"
