type: "Energy Weapons"
desc: "This advanced energy weapon generates intense blasts of microwave radiation. While it won’t irradiate you— microwaves are non-ionizing radiation—it can cause intense burns as whatever is hit by the blast is heated up from the inside, boiling the water in your cells. And metal is little protection: the microwave blast can’t effectively be dispersed by metallic objects, which heat up, produce electrical sparks, damage delicate circuitry. While extremely rare, these weapons provide a serious advantage when used against heavily armored targets."
