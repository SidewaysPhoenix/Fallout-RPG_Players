desc: "Plasma guns, or plasma casters, are high-tech weapons firing superheated ionized gas, or plasma. Powered by a plasma cartridge, these weapons are rare and potent, delivering damage through the high-speed impact of the plasma bolt and then thermal transfer as the heat from the plasma bolt is transferred into the target at the moment of impact. \n\n **Special:** Plasma guns inflict both Physical and Energy damage. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by whichever of the target’s damage resistances is lower out of Physical or Energy. Any Persistent damage effects (applied by weapon mods) inflict Energy damage. \n\n The default profile is for a plasma pistol. A plasma gun can accept one each of the following mods. Any Stock mods change the weapon to a plasma rifle. \n* **Capacitor:** [[Photon Exciter]], [[Beta Wave Tuner]], [[Boosted Capacitor]], [[Photon Agitator]], [[Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Maximized Capacitor]], [[Boosted Photon Agitator]], [[Boosted Gamma Wave Emitter]], [[Overcharged Capacitor]] \n* **Barrel:** [[Splitter]], [[Automatic Barrel]], [[Sniper Barrel]], [[Flamer Barrel]], [[Improved Barrel]], [[Improved Long Barrel]], [[Improved Automatic Barrel]], [[Improved Sniper Barrel]], [[Improved Splitter]] \n* **Stock:** [[Standard Stock]], [[Marksman’s Stock (Energy Weapons)|Marksman's Stock]], [[Recoil Compensating Stock (Energy Weapons)|Recoil Compensating Stock]] \n* **Sights:** [[Reflex Sight (Energy Weapons)|Reflex Sight]], [[Short Scope (Energy Weapons)|Short Scope]], [[Long Scope (Energy Weapons)|Long Scope]], [[Short Night Vision Scope  (Energy Weapons)|Short Night Vision Scope]], [[Long Night Vision Scope (Energy Weapons)|Long Night Vision Scope]], [[Recon Scope (Energy Weapons)|Recon Scope]]"
