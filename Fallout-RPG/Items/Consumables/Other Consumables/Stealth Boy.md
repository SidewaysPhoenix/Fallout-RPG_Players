chem name: "Stealth Boy"
desc: "One of the most interesting technologies developed before the War, the Stealth Boy 3001 is a compact device which generates a modulating refraction field which transmits light from one side of the field to the other. The result is near-perfect active camouflage, ranging from a sort of distorted transparency when moving to almost total invisibility when stationary. \n\n The Stealth Boy was reverse engineered from captured Chinese Stealth Armor during the War, and while the technology was never perfected—even the most advanced Stealth Boy consumes its battery in around 30 seconds—it was still seen to be reliable enough for service. \n Long-term use of Stealth Boy technology has been observed to cause permanent neurological changes, resulting in paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and other mental changes. \n\n **Use:** A Stealth Boy is activated using the [[Interact]] minor action. Once active, the device functions for three full turns: your current turn, your next turn, and your turn after that, after which, it ceases to function and is junk. When activated, a Stealth Boy renders you and the equipment you are carrying nearly invisible. Enemies add +2 to the difficulty of all tests to spot you; they may still hear you or notice your presence in other ways if they’re looking hard enough. In addition, even if you have been detected, the invisibility increases your Defense by +2."
