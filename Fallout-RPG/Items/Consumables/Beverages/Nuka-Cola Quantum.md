consumables name: "Nuka-Cola Quantum"
desc: "Introduced the same day the bombs fell, and thus difficult to find, Nuka-Cola Quantum was the newest flavor of Nuka-Cola to be released to the public, with twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice, the caffeine, and twice the taste. The drink’s distinctive blue glow comes from the (safe for human consumption) isotope additive developed by beverageers working with the United States military. Most bottles found were from special pre-release batches sent to chosen retailers or found in trucks in the process of shipping the product. The drink’s effects are extremely potent. \n\n You receive 1 cap upon opening and drinking a bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum."
