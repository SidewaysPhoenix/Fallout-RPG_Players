desc: "The hunt was long and the battle grueling, but you persevered. Naysayers told you there was no such thing as a Sheepsquatch, but you showed them! Congratulations on hunting one of the most elusive creatures in Appalachia; now it's time to carve it up into unrecognizable chunks to prove your hunting prowess to everyone. \n\n Sheepsquatch Meat can be cooked to make [[Lamb Chops]] or [[Mutton Meat Pie]].
