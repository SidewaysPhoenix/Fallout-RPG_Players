desc: "Sweet and floral, honey takes on the flavors of the local plants and greenery. Though there is short supply in many parts of the Wasteland, anywhere bees can still be found, so can honey. One of its strangest properties however is its incredible shelf life, as, if stored correctly, it never spoils. \n\n Honey can be added as a sweetener to any food or can be cooked to make [[Honey Cake]] or [[Grilled Giant Mantis]]."
