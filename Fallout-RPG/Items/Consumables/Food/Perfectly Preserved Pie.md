desc: "Contained within the storage of a Port-A-Diner, this slice of fruit pie has been shielded from the radioactive environment since before the Great War, meaning that isn’t irradiated at all. Copious quantities of preservatives were used in making the pie, so it’s still as edible as it was the day it was made."
