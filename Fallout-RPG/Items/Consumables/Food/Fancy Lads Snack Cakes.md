consumables name: "Fancy Lads Snack Cakes"
desc: "Small, frosted cakes, so laden with sugar and other sweeteners than they’re essentially preserved forever. Proclaimed in advertising to be “America’s Favorite Snackfood”, these cakes can be found across the wastelands, in many teeth-achingly sweet varieties. \n\n Sometimes, preserved boxes of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes can be found. These are identical to the listed version, but are not irradiated, and increase their rarity by +1."
