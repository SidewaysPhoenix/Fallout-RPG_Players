consumables name: "Melon"
desc: "A large, green, juicy fruit with a hard outer rind. Melons are grown in wasteland farms, or found growing wild in the wasteland. Either way, once cut open they’re often very satisfying, sating hunger and quenching thirst all in one go. \n\n Melons grown in non-irradiated conditions (such as within vaults or similar locations) are not irradiated but increase their rarity by +1."
