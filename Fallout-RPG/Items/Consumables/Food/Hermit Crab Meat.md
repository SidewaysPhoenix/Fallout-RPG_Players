consumables name: "Hermit Crab Meat"
desc: "Carefully extracted from the hermit crab, this meat is some of the best to be found in the Wastelands, which is probably why its prior owner was so careful about protecting itself. It's best eaten quickly, however, as the flesh starts to sour after death, rapidly rotting into a pungent slop. Hermit Crab Meat can be cooked to make Hermit Crab Steak."
