consumables name: "Radroach Meat"
desc: "Meat from the mutated, irradiated cockroaches known commonly as [[Radroach]]es. The meat is mildly radioactive and offers little in the way of nourishment or satisfaction, and it isn’t especially appetizing either. Cooking it provides only a marginal improvement. \n\n Radroach Meat can be cooked to make [[Grilled Radroach]]."
