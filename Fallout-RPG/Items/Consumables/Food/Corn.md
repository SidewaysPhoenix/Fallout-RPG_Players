consumables name: "Corn"
desc: "A highly versatile crop cultivated across the Americas for centuries. Corn remains largely unchanged by the War, and it remains a staple of wasteland agriculture. Corn grown in non-irradiated conditions (such as within vaults or similar locations) is not irradiated but increases its rarity by +1. In addition to its use as food, corn is a main ingredient in vegetable starch, which can be used to make adhesives for crafting."
