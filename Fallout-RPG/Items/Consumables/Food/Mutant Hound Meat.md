consumables name: "Mutant Hound Meat"
desc: "A cut of meat taken from a dead mutant hound. This meat’s off-green color and lumpy texture suggests that it would be quite unpleasant to eat. Eaten raw, it contains a fair amount of radiation and is unpalatable. Cooked, they’re still not the tastiest food, but they’re not hazardous. \n\n Mutant Hound Meat can be cooked to make [[Mutant Hound Chops]]."
