consumables name: "Food Paste"
desc: "In the years before the Great War, several charter schools across America entered an experimental program: The Nutritional Alternative Paste Program (NAPP). Developed by Vault-Tec in conjunction with the Federal Government, this supplied participating schools with a supply of food paste, fortified with vitamins, minerals and all the nutrients a growing body needs, and which would remain unspoiled for over a century. \n\n The paste is a flavorless mush, garish pink in color, and may have unknown long-term effects on psychology or physiology. It does, however, make the body healthier after consumption."
