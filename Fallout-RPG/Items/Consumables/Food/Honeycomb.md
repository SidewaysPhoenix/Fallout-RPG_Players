desc: "Pulled directly from inside a hive, where sheets of wax and raw honey await. A pleasant treat, whether you prefer to eat it whole or otherwise extract and filter the honey yourself. It's easy to see why it's so popular amongst those who have had it. \n\n Honeycomb can be broken down into [[Honey]] or cooked to make [[Honey Cake]]. "
