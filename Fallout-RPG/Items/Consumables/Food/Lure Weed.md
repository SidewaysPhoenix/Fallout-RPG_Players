consumables name: "Lure Weed"
desc: "Plucked from the misty banks of an island, these bio-luminescent plants give off a gentle light that sorrowfully extinguishes when harvested. The plant is watery and gentle when eaten raw, its insides translucent and soft. Though its collection can be dangerous, it's tasty and works well in the bases of stews and sauces. \n\n Lure Weed can be cooked to make [[Mongrel Ribs]]."
