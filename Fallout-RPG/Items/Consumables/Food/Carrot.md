desc: "A slightly mutated form of the common, orange root vegetable. Easy enough to grow in decent quantities, and useful for a variety of recipes, small wasteland farms often include a few carrot patches. \n\n Carrot is a component of several different recipes for food items. Carrots grown in non-irradiated conditions (such as within vaults or similar locations) are not irradiated but increase their rarity by +1."
