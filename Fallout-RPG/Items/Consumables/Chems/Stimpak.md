desc: "A stimulation delivery package, or Stimpak, is a form of fast-acting medication used to bolster the body’s own healing and recuperative ability, and countless millions were produced for household and workplace first aid kits, hospitals, clinics, and other places. A wonder of pre-War science, a Stimpak is a single-use syringe filled with a variety of potent healing agents, stimulants, and painkillers, and can be applied in an intravenous or intramuscular fashion: literally stick it anywhere and it’ll work. Even so, it a Stimpak is most effective when applied by an Auto-Doc or someone with medical training alongside other treatment. \n\n Sometimes encountered in a diluted form, reducing its effectiveness as the user is only taking a partial dose. [[Diluted Stimpaks]] are only about half as effective, but they’re easier to find. \n\n **Use:** A Stimpak can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the [[Take Chem]] minor action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury immediately, or it can be applied as part of a [[First Aid]] action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury in addition to any other healing done. [[Diluted Stimpaks]] work in the same way, but only heal 2 HP, though they can still treat Injuries as normal."

	Chem Duration
The Chemist perk (p.62 Core Rulebook) and the [[BioCommMesh]] armor 
upgrade (p.136 Core Rulebook) both increase the duration of chems taken.

This does not affect chems with an Instant duration.

Chems with a duration of Brief lasts one round. If the character has the armor upgrade or used a chem made by a Chemist character, then this is doubled to up to two rounds (so, until the end of your next turn, or until the recipient has taken two full turns under the effects of the chem).

Chems with a duration of Lasting lasts until the end of the next scene instead of the end of the current scene.


	Using Stimpaks
Stimpaks are incredibly useful pieces of medical technology, described in more detail on p.169 Core Rulebook. You can use a stimpak or similar forms of medication in one of two ways.

 With the **[[Take Chem]]** minor action, you inject the stimpak and receive an instant result. Your character (or a willing patient) immediately recovers 4 HP or treats one injury. If the person injected was dying, then they stabilize immediately.

 With the **[[First Aid]]** major action, you may administer a Stimpak as part of the action. The patient regains 4 HP immediately in addition to any other effects, and any AP spent to heal additional health points heal twice as much: 2 HP per AP spent, rather than 1.

Robots cannot be healed from Stimpaks, but you can use [[Robot Repair Kit]]s for the same benefits outlined here.
