chem name: "X-Cell"
desc: "X-cell was a general-purpose performance enhancer still being developed before the Great War. \n Development was never finished, but prototype versions were distributed through the black market and by scavengers after the War. It enhances all aspects of a user’s abilities for a few minutes, but it is extremely addictive, and the withdrawal symptoms are as far-reaching as the effects. \n\n **X-Cell Addiction:** A failed addiction roll renders you addicted to X-Cell. You increase the difficulty of all tests by +1 whenever you are not under the effects of X-Cell."

	Chem Duration
The Chemist perk (p.62 Core Rulebook) and the [[BioCommMesh]] armor 
upgrade (p.136 Core Rulebook) both increase the duration of chems taken.

This does not affect chems with an Instant duration.

Chems with a duration of Brief lasts one round. If the character has the armor upgrade or used a chem made by a Chemist character, then this is doubled to up to two rounds (so, until the end of your next turn, or until the recipient has taken two full turns under the effects of the chem).

Chems with a duration of Lasting lasts until the end of the next scene instead of the end of the current scene.
