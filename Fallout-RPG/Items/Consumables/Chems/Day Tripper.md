chem name: "Day Tripper"
desc: "A mild pre-War relaxant and hallucinogen, Day Tripper was favored by Americans seeking a brief escape from reality. The resulting high made users more laid-back and relaxed, while also making them less inclined to exert themselves physically. It was popular amongst many social groups during the stresses of the Great War, food riots, and general societal problems in the years before the bombs fell. \n\n **Day Tripper Addiction:** A failed addiction roll renders you addicted to Day Tripper. You increase the difficulty of all **CHA** and **LCK** tests by +1 whenever you are not under the effects of Day Tripper."
effects: "Reduce the difficulty of **CHA** and **LCK** tests by 1 (minimum 0), +1 difficulty to **STR** tests"

	Chem Duration
The Chemist perk (p.62 Core Rulebook) and the [[BioCommMesh]] armor 
upgrade (p.136 Core Rulebook) both increase the duration of chems taken.

This does not affect chems with an Instant duration.

Chems with a duration of Brief lasts one round. If the character has the armor upgrade or used a chem made by a Chemist character, then this is doubled to up to two rounds (so, until the end of your next turn, or until the recipient has taken two full turns under the effects of the chem).

Chems with a duration of Lasting lasts until the end of the next scene instead of the end of the current scene.
