chem name: "RadAway"
desc: "An intravenous drug which purges radiation from the user’s body, absorbing radiation as it circulates through the user’s bloodstream. It’s also a potent diuretic, expelling the radiation with the user’s urine, so it’s advisable to drink a lot of (clean) water shortly after taking a dose. \n\n Sometimes encountered in a diluted form, reducing its effectiveness as the user is only taking a partial dose. Diluted RadAway is only about half as effective, but it’s easier to find. \n\n **Use:** RadAway can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the Take Chem minor action, healing 4 Radiation damage immediately, or it can be applied as part of a First Aid action, healing 4 Radiation damage in addition to any other healing done (remove Radiation damage before applying other healing effects). Diluted RadAway works in the same way, but only heals 2 Radiation damage."

	Chem Duration
The Chemist perk (p.62 Core Rulebook) and the [[BioCommMesh]] armor 
upgrade (p.136 Core Rulebook) both increase the duration of chems taken.

This does not affect chems with an Instant duration.

Chems with a duration of Brief lasts one round. If the character has the armor upgrade or used a chem made by a Chemist character, then this is doubled to up to two rounds (so, until the end of your next turn, or until the recipient has taken two full turns under the effects of the chem).

Chems with a duration of Lasting lasts until the end of the next scene instead of the end of the current scene.
