name: "Dog, Mongrel"
desc: "A Mongrel Dog can be selected as a companion by any Ghoul or Wastelander character who takes the Dogmeat Perk. These mutated dogs often roam the Wastelands as aggressive packs, but can occasionally be ‘tamed’ by raiders or ghouls, the latter of whom smell less like a mongrel dog’s definition of ‘food’. "

 - name: "MOSTLY FERAL:"
   desc: "The Mongrel Dog is driven by feral instinct. Attempts to persuade or influence it with Speech tests increase in difficulty by +2. It will only respond to the simplest of commands— nothing more than a single word, and in your absence, it will move towards the nearest enemy, the nearest bright light, or the nearest loud noise."

   desc: "The Mongrel Dog reduces all Radiation damage suffered to 0, and it cannot suffer any damage or effects from radiation."
 - name: "ATTACK DOG:"
   desc: "This companion has been trained for battle. When you succeed at an attack, your companion also attacks, choosing to make a ranged attack or a melee attack (it may need to move before making this attack). The companion’s attack hits automatically but inflicts half the listed damage (rounded up), to a minimum of 2 D6 . If the companion is a Creature with natural melee attacks, at 5th level and every 5 levels beyond that, add +1 D6 damage to one of the creature’s natural melee attacks."
 - name: "COMPANION:"
   desc: " The Mongrel Dog’s level is the same as yours and increases whenever you level up. Increase Mongrel Dog’s **Body** or **Mind** by +1 when you reach level 3 or any odd-numbered level after that. Increase the Mongrel Dog’s HP by +1 per level, and with any increases to Body. The Mongrel Dog receives an additional Perk at 5th level and every 5 levels."
