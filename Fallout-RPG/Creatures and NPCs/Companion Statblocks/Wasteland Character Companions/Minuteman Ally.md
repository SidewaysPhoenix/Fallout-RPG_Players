name: Minuteman Ally
desc: "A minuteman ally can be chosen as a companion by any character who takes the Hired Help perk. Groups of Minutemen—and similar people’s militias in places outside the Commonwealth—are commonplace, made up of well-meaning settlers who believe in banding together to help those in need. A minuteman may find themselves accompanying other wanderers and survivors if they have a common cause or see an opportunity to help local settlements."
