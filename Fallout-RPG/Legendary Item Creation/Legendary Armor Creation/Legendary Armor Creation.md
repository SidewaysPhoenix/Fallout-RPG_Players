# Legendary Armor Overview

 The following are properties which can be applied to Legendary Armor. **Legendary Armor** always provides +1 to both Physical damage resistance and Energy damage resistance, in addition to the effects of any property it has.

Each Legendary Armor property can only apply once, unless otherwise stated.

To create a piece of **Legendary Armor**, first determine the piece of armor being made Legendary: this may be normal armor, or Power Armor. Then roll 1d20 to determine which property the armor receives, based on which location the armor piece covers. If the armor piece covers multiple locations, then choose one of the covered locations to receive the benefit.

You may spend a Luck point to adjust the result up or down by an amount equal to your LCK score.
