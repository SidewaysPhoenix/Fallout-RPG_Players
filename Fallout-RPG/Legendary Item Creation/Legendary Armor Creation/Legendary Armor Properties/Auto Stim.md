##### **Torso Armor**


Wearing **Auto Stim** armor will keep you in the fight! 

Once per scene, while wearing this armor, if your current HP is reduced to less than 1/4 of your maximum HP, you immediately use a [[Stimpak]] (or [[Stimpak (Diluted)]], or [[Super Stimpak]]) to heal yourself, as if you’d taken the Use Chem action. This does not take an action, and happens automatically outside of your turn. You **must** be carrying a Stimpak of some kind for this effect to happen.
