##### **Any Armor**

Wearing Rad Powered armor turns irradiation into unstoppable force! 

Once per scene, when you are wearing this armor and have one or more Radiation damage, you may take 1d20 from your dice pool (before rolling) on any **STR** test you attempt, and set it so that it counts as rolling a 1. You may do this one additional time per scene for every 5 Radiation damage you have.
