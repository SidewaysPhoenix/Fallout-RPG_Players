##### **Torso Armor, Leg Armor**

Wearing Punishing armor makes enemies regret attacking you! 

While wearing this armor, if you are hit by a melee attack, each Effect rolled on the damage roll inflicts 1 damage (of the same type as they are inflicting) to them; total up the damage before reductions from damage resistance.
