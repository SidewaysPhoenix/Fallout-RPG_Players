##### **Any Armor**

Wearing Martyr’s armor gives you a little more oomph when things seem dire! 

When you are wearing this armor, and your current HP are below 1/4 of your maximum HP, then you reduce the AP cost to take additional actions in combat by 1. 

**This does not stack with other effects that reduce the AP cost of extra actions, such as Jet.**
