##### **Any Armor**

Wearing Lucky armor brings fortune your way! 

Once per day, when you are wearing this armor, when you spend a Luck point to re-roll die, you may instead count a d20 you would have re-rolled so that it counts as rolling a 1, or any D6 you would have re-rolled as if they had rolled Effects.
