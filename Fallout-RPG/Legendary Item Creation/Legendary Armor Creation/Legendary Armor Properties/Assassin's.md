##### **Any Armor**

Wearing Assassin’s armor keeps raiders and other human foes off your back! 

This armor provides +2 Physical damage resistance and Energy damage resistance against attacks from human enemies. 

For the purposes of this rule, human characters are any PCs from the Brotherhood of Steel, Survivor, or Vault Dweller origins, and any PC with the **Human** keyword, but without the **Mutated** keyword.
