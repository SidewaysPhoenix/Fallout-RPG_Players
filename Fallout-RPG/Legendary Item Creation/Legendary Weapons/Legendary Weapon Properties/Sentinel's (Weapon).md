##### **Melee Weapons, Unarmed Attack** 

A **Sentinel’s** weapon is great for fending off enemy attacks! 

When you are wielding this weapon, you gain +2 Physical damage resistance and Energy damage resistance so long as you did not move in your previous turn. This increases to +3 to Physical and Energy damage resistance if the weapon has the [[Parry]] quality.
