##### **Small Guns.** 

A **Plasma** Infused weapon adds a plasma punch to every shot! 

This weapon inflicts +2 D6 damage, and deals both Energy and Physical damage, like a plasma weapon. Roll damage as normal, and then reduce the total by whichever of the target’s damage resistances is lower out of Physical or Energy.
