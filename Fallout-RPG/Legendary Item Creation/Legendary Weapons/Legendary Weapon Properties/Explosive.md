##### Small Guns 

An **Explosive** weapon fills the air with explosive bullets! 

When this weapon is used to make an attack, each Effect rolled on the attack’s damage roll hits a secondary target chosen by the GM within Close range of the main target. These secondary targets suffer half the damage rolled for the attack. The first secondary targets hit must be those within Reach of the main target (if any), and this effect does not stack with the [[Arc]] or [[Burst]] damage effects.
