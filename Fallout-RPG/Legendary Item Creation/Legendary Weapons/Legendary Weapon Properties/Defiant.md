##### **Small Guns, Energy Weapons, Big Guns** 

A **Defiant** weapon is deadly to the last shot! 

Once per scene, when you spend the maximum amount of ammo for the weapon’s Fire Rate, you may declare that the weapon is Empty after that attack. If you do so, the weapon inflicts +2 D6 damage, but you must spend a minor action to reload the weapon before it can be fired again.
