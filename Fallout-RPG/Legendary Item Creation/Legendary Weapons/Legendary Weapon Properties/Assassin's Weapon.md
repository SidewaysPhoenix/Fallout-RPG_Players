##### **Any Weapon** 

An Assassin’s weapon is deadly against humans! 

Against human characters, attacks with this weapon gain the **[[Vicious]]** damage effect. If the weapon is already **[[Vicious]]**, then it instead inflicts +2 damage per Effect rolled, rather than +1. 

For the purposes of this rule, human characters are any PCs from the Brotherhood of Steel, Survivor, or Vault Dweller origins, and any PC with the **Human** keyword, but without the **Mutated** keyword.
