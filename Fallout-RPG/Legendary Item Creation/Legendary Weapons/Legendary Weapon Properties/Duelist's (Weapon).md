##### Melee Weapons, Unarmed Weapons 

A **Duelist’s** weapon is great at turning aside enemy attacks! 

When the wielder of this weapon uses the [[Defend]] action and is missed with a melee attack, roll 1 D6. If an Effect is rolled, the attacker is disarmed, their weapon knocked from their hands and landing anywhere within Close range but outside of Reach.
