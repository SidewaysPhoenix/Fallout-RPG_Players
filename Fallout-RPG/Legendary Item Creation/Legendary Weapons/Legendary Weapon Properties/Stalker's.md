##### **Small Guns, Energy Weapons, Big Guns** 

A **Stalker’s** weapon is a devastating way to start a fight! 

When you make a sneak attack with this weapon, and you take no other actions other than an [[Aim]] minor action on that turn, you may replace 1d20 in your dice pool (before rolling) with a d20 that counts as having already rolled a 1.
