##### **Melee Weapons, Unarmed Weapons** 

A **Bloodied** weapon gets deadlier the closer the wielder is to death! 

When this weapon is wielded by a character whose current HP are less than their maximum HP, it inflicts +1 D6 damage. This increases to +2 D6 if the wielder has less than 3/4s of their maximum HP, to +3 D6 if they have less than 1/2 their maximum HP, and to +4 D6 if they have less than 1/4 their maximum HP.
