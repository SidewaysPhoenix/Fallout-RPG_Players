The following are properties which can be applied to Legendary Weapons. Some of these properties can only be applied to specific types of weapons. Only Small Guns, Energy Weapons, Big Guns, Melee Weapons, and Unarmed Weapons can be Legendary Weapons; Bows, Explosives, and Throwing Weapons cannot be.

To create a **Legendary Weapon**, first determine the weapon being made Legendary. Then roll 1d20 on the following table. This will determine which Legendary Weapons table to roll on. You may spend a Luck point to choose either table 1 or table 2 rather than rolling.

| 1D20 Roll | Table                     |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| 1-10      | [[Legendary Weapons Table 1]] |
| 11-20     | [[Legendary Weapons Table 2]] | 

On either table 1 or table 2, roll 1d20 to determine which property the weapon receives, according to the weapon’s type. You may spend a Luck point to adjust the result up or down by an amount equal to your LCK score.
