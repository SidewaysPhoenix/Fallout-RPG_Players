# Triggers
Traps can be triggered in various ways, allowing them to take into account the environment and space they are set up in, who and what they are intended to target, and how easily they need to be hidden.

> ##### TRIPWIRES 
> Tripwires are either run across a floor or doorway for an unsuspecting victim to stumble over or can be attached to doors to trigger traps once opened. Tripwires work when ‘tripped’ over, applying tension to a part of the trap, such as the trigger of a gun or the pin of a grenade, to set it off.
> ##### LASER TRIPWIRES
> Laser tripwires are an obvious trap trigger, noticeable by the crisscrossing red laser beams. They are most effective in obstructing hallways and doorways to prevent entry. These are usually hooked up to an existing defense system, such as a laser or machine gun turrets, which activate once one of the laser beams is broken or obstructed by a person or object.

> ##### TENSION TRIGGERS
> Tension triggers are small boxes usually attached to doors or containers, which can signal a trap to activate when there is a change in tension, such as the door or container lid opening.

> ##### BATHROOM SCALES AND PRESSURE PLATES 
> Since bathroom scales already work on a pressure plate design, they often get used as a pressure plate. Other forms of pressure plates can be jury-rigged. These triggers set traps off once pressure is applied, with some requiring manual resetting afterward.

> ##### PROXIMITY DETECTORS
> These are commonly found in the clapping cymbal monkey and radiation traps and work by detecting the presence of an intruder within a given radius of the trap. Some work on a delay, allowing the trap to only trigger after an intruder is in range for a set amount of time, while others trigger immediately.
