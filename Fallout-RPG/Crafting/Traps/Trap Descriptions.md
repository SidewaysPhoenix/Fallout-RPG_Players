# Types of Trap
While it’s possible to jury-rig an infinite number of contraptions to deter, harm, or capture intruders, the following are some common traps seen across the wasteland.

> ##### TESLA ARC 
> These devices are often mounted on the ceilings inside buildings, blending in with other pre-War ceiling fixtures. A tripwire or pressure plate causes the device to trigger, causing electricity to arc in all directions nearby.

> ##### FLAMETHROWER TRAP 
> These traps, when powered and fitted to a tripwire or pressure plate, will fill a nearby area with roaring flame. Effective, and quite impressive.

> ##### SPIKE TRAP 
> A more sophisticated trap than just putting spikes in a pit, this trap is made of a pressure-sensitive floor with holes for spikes to protrude through, covering the desired area. When pressure is applied to the floor, giant metal spikes shoot up, impaling anyone within the area. The trap then self-resets once the pressure is removed.

> ##### TRAPDOOR 
> This simple trap consists of a trapdoor that swings open when enough pressure or weight is applied, causing whatever is atop it to fall through into the space below it. These traps can be constructed to be nonlethal, with only a short drop and no other danger within its pit, or can be combined with other traps, hazards, or a long drop to cause harm to anything that triggers it.

> ##### SPRING TRAP 
> A simple trap made up of a sharp piece of jagged metal to serve as a blade, connected to a pressure plate. When pressure is applied to the plate, the spring-loaded makeshift blade releases and stabs its victim before self-resetting.

> ##### GRENADE BOUQUET 
> A grenade bouquet consists of one to three frag grenades bound together with wire or string. Triggering the trap causes the bouquet to drop to the floor, pulling the pins from the grenades, quickly detonating.

> ##### RADIATION EMITTER 
> These mines emit radiation using their sensors if an enemy wanders close. Not especially effective against Super Mutants or Ghouls, but a potent deterrent against raiders.

> ##### JURY-RIGGED GUNS 
> Any gun can be rigged to a trigger mechanism, turning it into a trap. Often triggered via trip wires across the ground or attached to doors, these traps are set to discharge a weapon at a would-be intruder. The simplest of these are pipe weapons and single-shot guns, which tend to be less accurate and less deadly, but more advanced and damaging traps can be made using automatic fire weapons or laser weaponry.

> ##### CLAPPING CYMBAL MONKEY 
> Once in the proximity of this trap, the toy monkey turns to look at intruders and show glowing green eyes. If the intruder stays within its line of sight for too long, its eyes will blink red, and the toy will clap its cymbals together, producing a large crashing sound. While this trap deals no damage, it can make others aware of the intruder’s presence. They will continue to clap the cymbals together until destroyed or disarmed.
