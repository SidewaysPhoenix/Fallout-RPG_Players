##### Trinkets
>Personal trinkets also allow your character to regain Luck points. Once per quest, outside of combat, your character can spend a few moments looking at the trinket, thinking about what it means to them. When you do, you regain 1 Luck point. See Personal Trinkets, p.80 for more details.
