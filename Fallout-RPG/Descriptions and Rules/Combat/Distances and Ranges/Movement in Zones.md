When you move into a zone as part of a movement action, you can move your character within reach of any object within that zone. So, when using the [[Move]] minor action to move into an adjacent zone, you can move to any point in that zone. Equally, when using the [[Sprint]] action, you can move to any point within a zone that is 2 zones away. This could put you into Reach with an enemy, or an object you need to get to.
