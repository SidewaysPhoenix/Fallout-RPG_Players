**Reach** is when an object or character is within arm’s length of your character. You can interact with objects and make melee attacks within your reach. Being in reach of an enemy is disruptive to ranged attacks and tests, adding +2 to the difficulty of any test that isn’t a melee attack.

 **Close** range represents any distance within the zone you’re in—a distance of 0 zones.

 **Medium** range is any distance to something in the zone adjacent to your current zone. Medium range is a distance of 1 zone.

 **Long** range represents objects two zones away from your current zone. Long range is a distance of 2 zones.

 **Extreme** range represents any objects beyond long range. Extreme range is a distance of 3 or more zones.
