If one or more Effects are rolled, the target suffers the weapon’s damage again at the end of their next and subsequent turns, for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. The target can spend a major action to make a test to stop persistent damage early, with the difficulty equal to the number of Effects rolled, and the attribute + skill chosen by the GM. Some Persistent weapons may inflict a different type of damage to the weapon, and where this is the case, it will be noted in brackets, for example: Persistent (Poison).
