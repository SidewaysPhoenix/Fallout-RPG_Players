You may be knocked prone by attacks, hazards, or complications. You may also drop prone willingly, at the end of any movement action you perform. Being prone has the following effects:

 When you’re prone, you crawl. The Move action becomes a major action, rather than a minor action, and you cannot take the Sprint action.

 While you’re prone, enemies at Medium range or further add +1 to the difficulty of any attacks against you.

 While you’re prone, enemies at Close range reduce the difficulty of attacks (including melee attacks) by 1, to a minimum of 0.

 While you’re prone, you can re-roll any cover D6 you have
