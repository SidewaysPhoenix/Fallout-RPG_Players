Radiation damage is applied differently than other damage types. Each point of radiation damage, after reduction for the location’s radiation DR, reduces a character’s **maximum health points**, rather than their current health points. If a character’s health point maximum is reduced below their current health point total, then their current HP are reduced as well.

Radiation damage is only reduced by a target’s radiation Damage Resistance, according to the location hit. If the radiation would affect the whole body, like an environmental effect, then use the character or creature’s **lowest** locational radiation DR.

In all cases, where a character would suffer radiation damage and another type of damage at the same time, resolve the radiation damage after any other types of damage.

***Example:** Piper is attacked by a glowing feral ghoul, taking 3 D6 radiation damage. The GM rolls their D6 and totals 4 damage with an Effect, inflicting 4 physical damage and 1 radiation damage. Piper has 2 physical resistance, so she reduces her current health points by 1. Then, she reduces her maximum health points by 1 because of the radiation damage.*
