During combat, you can spend Action Points to do the following:

 **Buy d20s (1–6 AP):** Buy bonus d20s for a test, before the dice pool is rolled, but after the GM sets the difficulty. The cost increases for each die purchased: the first d20 costs 1 AP, the second costs 2, and the third costs 3. No more than three bonus d20s may be rolled for a single test, including any d20s from perks or traits.

 **Obtain Information (1 AP):** Ask the gamemaster a 
single question about the current situation, based on your 
test. The GM will answer truthfully, but the answer might 
not be complete.

 **Take Additional Minor Action (1 AP):** Take 1 additional minor action in your turn. You can only take a total 
of 2 minor actions in a single round.

 **Take Additional Major Action (2 AP):** Take one additional major action on your turn. Any skill test you must attempt is increased in difficulty by +1. You can only take a total of two major actions in a single round.

 **Add Extra Damage (1-3 AP):** On a successful melee attack or thrown weapon attack you can spend AP to add 1 D6 per AP spent, up to a maximum of +3 D6 for 3 AP.
