 The weapon operates on a timer or fuse, and will not detonate immediately. A [[Thrown]] Delay weapon can be thrown normally to the target location, while other Delay weapons may be placed in their desired location. A Delay (1) weapon detonates at the start of the first round after it is thrown or otherwise triggered. A Delay (2) weapon detonates at the start of the round after that, and so on.
