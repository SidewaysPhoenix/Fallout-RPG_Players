 The weapon consumes ammo at a much higher rate than other weapons. Each time the weapon is fired, it spends X ammo, rather than 1. In addition, extra damage requires spending X ammo per +1 D6, with a maximum number of D6 equal to the weapon’s Fire Rate. Additional uses of ammunition, such as the [[Burst]] damage effect, also spend X ammo for every 1 ammo that would normally be spent.
