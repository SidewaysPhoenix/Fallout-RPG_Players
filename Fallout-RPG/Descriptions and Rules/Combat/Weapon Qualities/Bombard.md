The weapon can deliver a series of explosions over a wide area. This functions identically to the [[Blast]] quality, with one addition: When an attack is made with the weapon, you may spend additional ammunition to target additional zones. Each additional zone requires that 2 ammunition be spent, and additional zones must be adjacent to the initial target zone. Ammunition spent to target additional zones is limited by the weapon’s Fire Rate.
