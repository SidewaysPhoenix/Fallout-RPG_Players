 The explosive device is placed in a specific location and set to detonate, often either with the [[Delay]] (X) quality or the Remote quality. Placing the explosive requires a **PER + Explosives** test with a difficulty of 1; this increases to 2 if you’ve been attacked since your last turn. Failure means the bomb hasn’t been set properly and will not detonate (or, if a complication is rolled, may have been set improperly, and may detonate unexpectedly). Success means the bomb has been set up properly.
