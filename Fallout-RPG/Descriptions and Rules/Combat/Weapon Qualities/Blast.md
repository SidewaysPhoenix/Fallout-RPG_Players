When you make an attack with a Blast weapon, you do not target a single opponent. Instead, select a single zone you can see, and make the appropriate skill test to attack, with a basic difficulty of 2 (adjusted for range as normal). If you succeed, every creature (and other damageable target) in that zone suffers the weapon’s damage. If you fail, your misplaced attack is less effective: roll only half the weapon’s D6 to determine the damage inflicted to creatures in the target zone and ignore the weapon’s normal damage effects.
