**Difficult terrain** describes any ground that requires more effort to cross, either because it hinders you or because you need to be careful where you step. A zone may be filled with difficult terrain, slowing anyone attempting to cross it.

**Obstacles** are similar in that they hinder your movement, but they exist between zones—attempts to move from one zone to another where an obstacle is present may slow your progress. Obstacles may be barriers you need to climb up or over, or they might be gaps that you need to jump past.

When you attempt to move from an area of difficult terrain, or cross an obstacle, you must spend one or more extra Action Points to do so, depending on how difficult the terrain or obstacle is.

If you do not have sufficient Action Points available, then you need to find some way to generate them. The simplest way to do this is to take the [[Rally]] major action, generating action points with a Difficulty 0 **STR** + **Athletics** test—any successes become AP, which can be spent on moving through the terrain.
