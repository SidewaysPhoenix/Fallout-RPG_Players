Cover provides additional Damage Resistance against physical and energy-based attacks. Objects in the environment will provide a certain amount of DR, as a number of Combat Dice (D6  ), depending on what they’re made from and how resilient they are. When you are attacked by a physical or energy-based attack while behind cover, roll the number of D6  listed in the Cover Values table and add that result to your DR for that attack.

To benefit from cover, it needs to obscure the location hit, whether that’s from a melee or ranged attack. You can’t be targeted by an attack if the cover obscures your character’s entire body, as you can only be attacked by something that can see you.
