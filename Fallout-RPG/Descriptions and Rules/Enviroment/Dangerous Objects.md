An environment may contain objects that inflict damage or cause other effects based on the actions of those present—mines and other traps are common examples—as many folk in the wasteland use traps and even automated turrets to defend what’s theirs.

A dangerous object is triggered by a specific action occurring nearby. This might be a complication, or occur when a character enters a specific zone. Characters must attempt a test to avoid the damage **(AGI + Athletics or PER + Survival** to either dodge the trap or to spot the trigger just in time).
