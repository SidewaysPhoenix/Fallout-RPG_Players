When your character is reduced to 0 HP, they suffer an injury to the location struck, and then fall prone and start **dying**. If they suffer a critical hit and are reduced to 0 HP, they suffer two injuries: one for the critical hit, and one for being reduced to 0 HP.

While they are dying, they are unconscious, cannot recover HP from the [[First Aid]] action, and cannot take any actions. Furthermore, at the start of each of your turns while they’re dying, you must attempt an **END +** **Survival** test, with a difficulty equal to the number of injuries they have, and a complication range of 19-20. If you pass this test, they remain alive, but are still dying. If you fail, they die.

If they suffer any damage while dying, they immediately gain one additional injury, in addition to any injury caused by another critical hit.
