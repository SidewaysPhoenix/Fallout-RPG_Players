A **critical hit** occurs whenever a character suffers **five or more damage in one hit** (after reductions from Damage Resistance). A critical hit imposes an injury on the character, which confers a penalty depending on the location hit.

 **Arm:** You drop any object held in that hand, and the arm is broken or otherwise unable to move. You cannot perform any actions using that arm—by itself or alongside your other arm.

 **Leg:** You immediately fall prone as your leg gives out under your weight. You can no longer take the [[Sprint]] action, and the [[Move]] action is now a major action for you. 

 **Torso:** You begin bleeding heavily. At the end of each of your subsequent turns, you suffer 2 D6  physical damage, ignoring all your Damage Resistances.

 **Head:** You are momentarily dazed and lose your normal actions in your next turn (though you may spend AP for extra actions as normal). Further, you cannot see clearly, and increase the difficulty of all tests which rely on vision by +2.

These effects last until the injury has received medical attention (see p.34 Core Rulebook).
