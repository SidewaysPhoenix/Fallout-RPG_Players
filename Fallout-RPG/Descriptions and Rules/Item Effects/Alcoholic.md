All alcoholic drinks have the same effect: Until the end of the scene, you may re-roll 1d20 on STR and CHA tests, but increase the difficulty of INT tests by +1. In addition, alcoholic drinks are addictive: after drinking the beverage, roll a few CD  equal to the number of alcoholic drinks you’ve consumed during this session. If two or more Effects are rolled, you are addicted, and add +1 to the difficulty of CHA and AGI tests while not under the effects of an alcoholic drink. The Party Boy/Party Girl perk (p.69) renders you immune to alcohol addiction.
