You can salvage component materials from junk items and from other items you wish to dispose of to use them later for repairs and for crafting. Salvage requires that you have appropriate tools or facilities, such as a workbench. 

* Salvaging junk takes 10 minutes per item being salvaged and requires an **INT + Repair** test with a difficulty of 0. Success yields component materials according to the listing of the items salvaged on the tables above. If an item can be salvaged for a random amount of component materials, roll for this when you salvage the items. 

* Salvaging items takes 10 minutes per item and requires an **INT + Repair** test with a difficulty of 0. Success yields one unit of a single component material used in making the item, determined by the GM (i.e., Iron from a gun, leather from leather armor, etc.) You may spend AP to produce one additional unit of a component material per AP spent, but no item may yield more units than the item’s weight in total. 

* Consumable items cannot be salvaged: you cannot unmix chems, or uncooked meat. 

* You cannot salvage ammunition: the means to do so requires tools that are nearly impossible to find in the Wasteland. 

When salvaging non-junk items, you can only receive materials marked as common on the table below. The [[Scrapper]] perk (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.71) allows you to receive uncommon and rare materials when salvaging items. Adhesive and Oil can never be obtained from salvaging non-junk items.
