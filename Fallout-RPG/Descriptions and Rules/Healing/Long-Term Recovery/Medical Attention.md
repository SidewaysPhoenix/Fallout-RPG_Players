Characters may require long-term medical care if they’ve been injured, poisoned, or are suffering from a disease. A single character can provide medical attention for a number of patients equal to their **Medicine** rating.

For injuries, each day of rest and medical attention a patient receives allows you to assist their **END + Survival** test at the end of the day to heal their injuries, using your own **INT + Medicine** target number. 

For poisons and diseases, you may assist the patient’s **END + Survival** tests to help them recover. If the patient spent the entire day resting, they reduce the difficulty of this test by 1 allowing them to recover more quickly. This is covered in more detail on p.194 Core Rulebook.
