**Injury Recovery Difficulty**

| Activity                                         | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Restful (no strenuous activity all day)          | 1          |
| Light (only a small amount of travel or similar) | 2          |
| Moderate (travel, but no combat)                 | 3          |
| Heavy (travel and combat)                        | 4          |
|                                                  |            |

Rest is the easiest way to recover from damage, though it is slow. If you can find somewhere to sleep, for at least six hours, you regain all lost HP.If you’re able to get eight hours of sleep somewhere safe and comfortable—your own bed in a settlement you belong to, for example—then you are considered [[Well Rested]] as well, and your maximum HP is increased by +2 until you next sleep.

When you sleep, if you have any injuries (treated or otherwise), make an **END + Survival** test with a difficulty of 1. The complication range on this test increases by +1 for each injury that has not been treated. If you succeed, you may recover from one of those injuries, plus an additional injury for every 2 AP spent.

You may only sleep once in any 24-hour period. Going without sleep for long periods can also be harmful (see Survival, p.190 Core Rulebook).
