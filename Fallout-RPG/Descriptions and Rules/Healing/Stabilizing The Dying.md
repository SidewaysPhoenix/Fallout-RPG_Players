Using the First Aid action, you can attempt to stabilize a dying character. This requires an **INT + Medicine** test with a difficulty equal to the number of injuries the patient has. Passing the test restores the character to 1 HP and they are no longer dying, and their player no longer has to attempt **END + Survival** tests to avoid death. The character remains unconscious and unable to take actions. 

If radiation damage has reduced their maximum health points to 0, they cannot be stabilized until their maximum health points are above 0, by healing the radiation damage.

If you stabilize the patient, you can spend AP to heal additional health points. You can heal 1 HP for every AP spent. You may also spend 1 AP after stabilizing a character to wake them from unconsciousness, allowing them to continue to act.
