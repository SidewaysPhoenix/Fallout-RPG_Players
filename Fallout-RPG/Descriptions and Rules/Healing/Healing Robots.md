Robots and other machines cannot recover from injuries naturally, and they require maintenance to restore damage.

Attempting the [[First Aid]] action on a robot, a suit of power armor, or other large machine (like a vehicle) requires an **INT + Repair** test, with a difficulty of 2. This increases by +1 for each injury the machine has suffered. Passing the test restores health points equal to your Repair rating, treats an injury, or stabilizes a dying machine. Machines cannot use chems, though a repair kit functions for machines as Stimpaks do for living characters.

Machines cannot heal through eating, drinking, rest, or medical attention. Outside of combat, an hour’s work on a damaged machine restores HP equal to twice the repairer’s **Repair** skill rating.
