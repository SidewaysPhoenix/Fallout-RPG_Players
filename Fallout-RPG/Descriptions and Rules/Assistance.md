Difficult tasks are often completed through teamwork. When someone else is attempting a test, you can assist them if your GM allows it. Describe how you are helping and decide with the GM which attribute + skill combination you’re using—it doesn’t have to be the same combination as the person you’re helping. Then, roll 1d20 and add any successes you generate to theirs, providing they score at least 1 success of their own. If they didn’t generate any successes, then you can’t add your success to the total.
