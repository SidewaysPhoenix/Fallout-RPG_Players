When you check your successes against the task difficulty, each success you generate above the difficulty becomes an Action Point. For example, if the task’s difficulty is 2, and you generate 3 successes, the extra success becomes 1 Action Point.

Action Points can be used to take additional actions, improve the outcome of a test, reduce the time it takes, learn more about a situation, or buy more d20s in future tests.

You can spend Action Points to do the following:

**Buy d20s (1–6 AP):** Buy bonus d20s for a test, before the dice pool is rolled, but after the GM sets the difficulty. The cost increases for each die purchased: the first d20 costs 1 AP, the second costs 2, and the third costs 3. No more than three bonus d20s may be rolled for a single test, including any d20s from perks or traits.

**Obtain Information (1 AP):** Ask the gamemaster a single question about the current situation, based on your test. The GM will answer truthfully, but the answer might not be complete.

**Reduce Time (2 AP):** AP from a successful test can allow the test to take less time to complete, when time is important. Spending 2 AP halves the amount of time a test takes to attempt. In combat, you can spend Action Points to do the following:

**Take Additional Minor Action (1 AP):** Take 1 additional minor action in your turn. You can only take a total of 2 minor actions in a single round.

 **Take Additional Major Action (2 AP):** Take one additional major action on your turn. Any skill test you must attempt is increased in difficulty by +1. You can only take a total of two major actions in a single round.

 **Add Extra Damage (1-3 AP):** On a successful melee attack or thrown weapon attack you can spend AP to add 1 D6 per AP spent, up to a maximum of +3 D6 for 3 AP.

| Dicepool | Bonus D20s | AP Cost |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 2d20     | -          | 0       |
| 3d20     | +1d20      | 1       |
| 4d20     | +2d20      | 3       |
| 5d20     | +3d20      | 6       |

You spend Action Points either before or after you roll dice, and each option describes when you can spend Action Points to take advantage of its effect. You buy extra d20s for a test before you roll, while you spend Action Points after a test to obtain information, reduce the time, improve the quality of the success, or take an additional action.
