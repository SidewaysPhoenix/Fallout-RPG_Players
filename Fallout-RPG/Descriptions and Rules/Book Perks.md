# Book Perks Overview
 Books and magazines are old pre-War publications which provided information and entertainment to the masses. In the Wasteland, they’re a useful source of forgotten or rare information. 
 
 When you discover a book or magazine during looting or when trading with someone else, instead of rolling on the random publication table on p.172 of the **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, you may spend 1 Luck point to discover a Rare Book; some of the items are found in the form of holotapes rather than books, but they’re all treated the same way in game. These have a weight of <1, a cost of 500, and a rarity of 4. Roll on the table below to determine which Rare Book is found. 
 
 A Rare Book contains a rare perk: reading the book (taking an hour) grants the character access to a perk which is not normally available to characters when they level up. A character who has gained access to a rare perk may select that perk when they level up.
