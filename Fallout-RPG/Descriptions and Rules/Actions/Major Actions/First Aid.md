You try to quickly patch the wounds of yourself or an ally. Make an **INT + Medicine** test, with a difficulty equal to the number of injuries the patient has, and increase the difficulty by 1 if you are trying to perform first aid on yourself. If you succeed, you can either:

 Heal HP equal to your Medicine rating (p.34 Core Rulebook),

 Treat one injury the patient is suffering from 
(p.34 Core Rulebook), or 

 Stabilize a dying patient (p.34 Core Rulebook)
