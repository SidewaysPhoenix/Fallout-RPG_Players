## MAKING REPAIRS 

Many items cannot be crafted from scratch—at least, not without precision tools that are extremely difficult to find, which are beyond the scope of the rules here—but they can still be repaired when they suffer damage or wear and tear. 

Repairing an item to full function requires an appropriate workbench, and materials determined by the Rarity of the item being repaired (detailed on the following table), and an INT + Repair test with a difficulty equal to the item’s rarity. If you possess another item of that type (i.e., you’re trying to repair a 10mm pistol, and you have a second 10mm pistol on hand), you can scrap that item while making repairs. This both provides the materials needed and reduces the difficulty by 1. This takes half an hour (halved to fifteen minutes by spending 2 AP if you’re successful, complications may add an extra fifteen minutes to the time). 

[[Repair Costs]]

When repairing an item, increase the complication range of the repair test by +1 for each mod the item has—modified items are trickier to repair and there’s more chances of something going wrong. Complications can make the repairs take longer, as noted above, or result in additional materials being wasted.
